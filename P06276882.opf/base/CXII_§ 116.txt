[116] Again, king Ajātaśatru said this to the Elder Ānanda: "What deed, venerable Ānanda, did
the monk Suvarṇavarṇa perform,due to the ripening of which he was placed upon a stake though
faultless and harmless, and having gone forth became an Arhat?The Elder Ānanda said:
"Formerly, O great king, in the past, the Perfectly Awakened One, Candra by name, was born
in the world.The Tathāgata, the Worthy One, the Perfectly Awakened One, endowed with wisdom
and good conduct, the Sugata, world-knowing, having no superior, tamer of men worthy of
being tamed, the teacher of gods and of men, the Awakened, the Fortunate One, dwelt near
a certain capital city.Now, at that time, in a certain monastery was a certain monk, a preacher
of the law.He preached the law to the Brahmans and householders that came to him from
time to time.There arose great profit and honour for him.
