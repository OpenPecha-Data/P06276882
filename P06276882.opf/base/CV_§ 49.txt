cemetery with the lad Suvarṇavarṇa.The maiden Kāśisundarī, too, placed upon a bier decorated
with blue, yellow, red, and white cloth,was taken out by her own relatives to the
great cemetery. Her relatives put her down at a certain place, and having gathered wood began
to build a funeral pile.They were told by those executioners:"You should not place her
upon the funeral pile as yet.Wait till we execute the lad Survarṇavarṇa by impaling him upon
the stake, because the lad Suvarṇavarṇa should be cremated upon the same pyre together
with the maiden Kāśisundarī."Having said so, they began to erect the stake upon the ground.
