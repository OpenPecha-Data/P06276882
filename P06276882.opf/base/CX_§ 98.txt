[98] Thereupon, the Fully Awakened One, Vipaśyin, discharged a radiance by which that ruined
lying-in chamber suddenly became possessed of a radiance of molten gold both within and without.
The radiance abounded in the colour of extremely purified liquid gold.It surpassed
a thousand flashes of lightning; in its redness it was like the fire kindled with the pouring
of showers of butter oblations; like full-blown Kiṃśuka, Aśoka, red-lotus, Kuraṇṭa, and
Karavīra; like the twilight clouds; like Campaka, the sap of the Kusumbha; like the palate
of an elephant, and like rubies.[See two records above]Seeing it, the caravan leader Karṇa
arose wondering "What is this?",and saw the Fortunate, the Fully Awakened One, Vipaśyin,
his figure adorned with the thirty-two marks of a great man. He was, as it were, the embodiment
of the Law. He was like the sacrificial-fire sprinkled with oblations.His body was
covered with a halo of lustre the colour of refined liquid gold, karṇikāra, kuṅkuma, kusumbha,
haritāla, manaḥśilā, red-lotus, tinted clouds of autumn twilights, necks of peacocks,
clouds, onyx, royal fillets, Hiṅguluka, Atimuktaka, and Kuraṇṭaka.On looking at him, there
arose great faith in the caravan leader Karṇa.Thinking "What shall I give the Fortunate
One?", he surveyed his possessions and saw that single bean-cake.Taking it, he said to
his wife: "Good lady, I brought this bean-cake thinking that I should not indeed enter the
house empty-handed.Now, this Fortunate One, the Fully Awakened One, Vipaśyin, is most worthy
of gifts and compassionate towards the wretched and the miserable.The seed of a gift,
though small, bestowed hereupon, eradicates the misfortune of poverty.I will therefore give
this bean-cake to the Fortunate One."She replied: "Noble sir, it is excellent. Please do
so.Even this much root of merit will be a cause for happiness in our transmigrations."
