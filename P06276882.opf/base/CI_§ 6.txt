[6] Knowing her to be pregnant he maintained her, unconstrained, in the upper terrace of the
palace;with remedies against the cold in the cold season and remedies against the heat in
the hot season, and with foods prescribed by physicians, not too bitter, not too sour, not
too salt, not too sweet, not too pungent and not too astringent, with foods free from bitterness,
sourness, salt, sweetness, pungency and astringency. Her limbs decked with full
garlands of pearls and necklaces of many strings, like an Apsaras strolling in the Nandana-grove,
she passed from bed to bed and seat to seat without descending upon the ground below.
Nor did she hear an unpleasant noise till the maturing of the embryo.She gave birth after
a lapse of eight or nine months.A boy was born, handsome, charming, pleasant and endowed
with all the major and minor limbs.Possessed of an excellence of complexion, the colour
of purified gold, he captivated the eyes and minds of all people. His body was covered with
golden-yellow garments.The fragrance of sandal issued from his entire body and that of
the blue lotus from his mouth.At the very moment of his birth there fell a shower of garments
and of Karṇikāra flowers. Those garments were golden hued.
