[55] Now, in the meantime, the Elder Ānanda, the Magnanimous One, as he came, said from quite
a distance, filling all the quarters with a penetrating voice, and consoling the lad, Suvarṇavarṇa:"Do
not fear, child, I bear this body which resembles a venomous snake only for
the sake of people amenable to instruction, such as you.So, child, do not fear.I will deliver
you today from this danger.Today, I fulfill the wish of the Fortunate One, the Awakened
One.This very day, I will render fruitful that teaching which was entrusted to me by the
Fortunate One, the Knowing One, the Perceptive One, the Tathāgata, the Worthy One, the Fully
Awakened One, and by the Great Elder Kāśyapa.Today, I will make manifest the magnanimity
of the chief disciples of the Tathāgata.Today, I fulfill your wish.Today, I remove this
fear of yours, of death and of transmigration.Today, I pluck out the shaft of your doubt
and uncertainty.Today, I cleanse your eyes which are obstructed by the veil of heterodox
doctrines with a dab of the ointment of knowledge.Today, I destroy the fire of your anger.Today,
I clothe you with passionlessness.Today, I cause your seeds of merit to sprout.Today,
I extricate you from the mire of transmigration.Today, I ferry you across the ocean of
suffering.Today, I lead you towards the other side of the wilderness of transmigration.Today,
I cut asunder the bonds of your defilements.Today, I break down the door-panels of your
hindrances.Today, I will act in such a way that you, by abandoning all major and minor defilements,
will attain Arhatship which is difficult to attain in endless crores, millions,
hundreds and thousands (of kalpas).

Today, you will consume the entire fuel of the defilements with the fire of knowledge. Today,
you will become freed from sickness, cleared of the doubts in your mind. (1)Today you, O
child, will cut down altogether and at once the tree of (re)birth that has long endured and
is difficult to be hewn, with the great thunderbolt of knowledge. (2)Boarding the ship
of vigour, you will today cross over the ocean of existence with its water of passion, whirlpools
of pride and waves of conceit. (3)With the great thunderbolt of wisdom, you will rend
asunder the mountain of suffering with re-births for its mass, old age for its basis and
abounding in crags of death. (4)Today, dear child, you will obtain that state which being
free from the influxes and very difficult to obtain, you did not obtain in thousands of
crores of kalpas." (5)
