[31] On hearing that, the lad Suvarṇavarṇa’s mother, smitten with intense grief, fainted and
fell on the ground.Then, her senses returned with the sprinkling of water, she arose, and,
lamenting: "Alas, my son, alas my son", tearing her hair, beating her breasts, trembling
and falling into a stupor again and again, came out of the house and on to the street.Smitten
with the sorrow of separation from her son, bewildered at heart, and uttering various
lamentations, she asked each person:"By which road will the lad Suvarṇavarṇa be taken?"Wailing:
"Alas! I do not see my son. Help me, help me, show me my son", she set out along the
middle of the street.
