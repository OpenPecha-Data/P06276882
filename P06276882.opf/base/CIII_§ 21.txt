[21] The lad, Suvarṇavarṇa, too, set out from Rājagṛha and arrived at his own park.When he saw
the maiden Kāśisundarī dragged hither and thither, her hair dishevelled, and fallen senseless
upon the ground, he was greatly moved.He reflected : "Having been brought here, she
has been slain by somebody who is evil-natured, pitiless at heart, has given up all expectation
of the future world, and is persistent in his enmity.Oh! alas! There are indeed beings
even such as these who would unmercifully strike a woman such as this".He searched that
entire park and when he did not see anyone, it occurred to him:"This woman is well-known;
she has been slain in this park, and I do not see anyone here.In every way, revealing the
evil nature within himself some wicked person has let fall this thunderbolt of disgrace
upon my head."Thus distracted in mind he remained lost in thought with his cheek resting upon
his hand.
