[26] The minister, Pracaṇḍa, seeing them talking to one another, asked:"Sirs, why do you just
stand there? Take him away quickly."With clasped hands, they began to request him:"Lord,
be pleased. Though we are executioners, indeed, we nevertheless cannot bear to kill an excellent
person such as this one who is dear to the populace."The minister, Pracaṇḍa became
very angry and said:"Sirs, should you not kill him, today your very lives and those of your
children, wives and kinsmen will cease to be."They trembled and said to one another: "Sirs,
the undertakings of this minister do not conform with justice.Whence could it be that
he who would strive to forsake thus the lad Suvarṇavarṇa, an excellent person, the sight
of whom is extremely difficult to obtain, would not kill us together with our children, wives
and kinsmen?We are, therefore, in great danger. How should we proceed in this matter?"To
them, frightened by the fear of death, the thought arose:"This lad is dear to the populace.
Therefore, let us now take him to the street.There is the chance that the mass of the
populace itself will set him free.Who, indeed, is able to be indifferent towards him when
he is about to be killed."They approached near him to tie his hands behind,but having seen
him resplendent on account of the excellence of the nobility of his figure, they were not
able to touch him.Then, trembling in every limb, and their voices faltering on account of
being choked with tears, they began to utter lamentations."Ah, alas! such evil-doers, indeed,
are we, that we are ordered to carry out a deed that should not be done such as this."
