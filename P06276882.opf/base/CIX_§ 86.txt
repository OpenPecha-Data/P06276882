[86] The caravan leader’s wife thought:"I am, indeed, abandoned by all the female and male slaves,
workmen and servants, and by friends, associates and relations.My whole life is dependent
upon this handmaid.She is like my mother in affection.Now, working alone for so long
a time, she will become exhausted.Also, it is not possible to maintain ourselves with what
money she obtains.Therefore, I, too, will suffer the sin of my own mis-deeds.I, too, will
work for wages." Thinking thus, she began to go to the houses of others together with that
handmaid and work for wages.She was very delicate, and being tormented by the pains such
as of hunger, swooned again and again while working.Then, exhausted, heaving a long and
hot sigh, and calling to mind the caravan leader Karṇa, she began to cry:"Ah, alas! Such
is the reversal that has befallen me that, indeed, having once enjoyed an abundance of fortune
as the best in the entire city, I, who was the foremost therein, now, in this very birth,
experience great pain and dejection, working for wages in the houses of others."
