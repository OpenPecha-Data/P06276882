[38] That caravan leader was well-known and was one that had made friends.As it was his bidding,
and on account of their love for virtues of the boy, they agreed.Then, they dispatched
citizens, clever men of business, to the royal palace, telling them:"If this boy is again
investigated more thoroughly, today, we too shall give the king a 100,000 of gold?"Then
those citizens, men of business, departed for the hall of justice.They were observed even
from a distance by the minister Pracaṇḍa and told: "Sirs, what is the reason for your arrival?"They
replied: "The citizens residing in Rājagṛha request thus: "As this boy, Suvarṇavarṇa,
is dear to the populace - on account of being excessively endowed with an excellence
of nobility of figure, great is the suffering of the mass of people inhabiting Rājagṛha on
account of their separation from him.Because of his constant delight in righteousness and
his being endowed with virtues such as discipline, no one will credit this crime to him.Therefore,
we will give a 100,000 of gold and the caravan leader Divākara will give all his
wealth.At our request let the boy Suvarṇavarṇa be brought back and again investigated thoroughly.When
this is done our request will have been fruitful and the king’s treasury augmented."
