[28] On hearing that, the mass of the populace, smitten by the sorrow of separation from him,
began to cry out in unison:"This lad is so handsome, charming and pleasant, endowed with
all the major and minor limbs, possessed of an excellence of a complexion, the colour of
purified gold, and captivates the eyes and minds of all people.He is learned, well-behaved,
amiable, clever, compassionate and magnanimous. He is law-abiding, and dear to living beings.
Ah, alas! how can he be executed!Have the holy ones perished? Has the law disappeared
and has there come into being unrivaled supremacy of the sovereignty of the kingdom of unrighteousness
alone?Ah, alas! Sirs:

With highest perfection of beauty and form is he adorned, whom whenever we beheld, great pleasure
was ours. (1)Now, beholding that same one, guarded by the executioners, our minds, overcome
by intense grief, become rent asunder, as it were. (2)How, indeed, is punishment inflicted
by the king upon him who, by reason of captivating their minds and eyes, is dear
to the populace. (3)Today, abandoning compassion, how have the ministers given up for execution
him, ever beholding whom, living creatures find no satisfaction? (4)How, indeed, could
a crime such as this be thought possible of him whose conduct is well mannered and famed
as that of a sage? (5)Unrighteousness is indeed awake, while righteousness sleeps or else
is dead, that this separation from one that is even so virtuous is at hand." (6)
