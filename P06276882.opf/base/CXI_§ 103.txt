[103] Now, even as he made this earnest wish, that ugliness of the lad Virūpa disappeared suddenly.He
became handsome, charming and pleasant; the skin of his limbs was of a golden colour.His
body was immediately covered with clothes of a golden hue that came unexpectedly
through the sky, as well as with excellent ornaments of great value such as bracelets and
ear-rings.The gods let fall a great shower of flowers such as the karnikāra, blue-lotus, campaka,
red-lotus, white water-lily and māndāraka.Also discharged was a divine shower of powdered
sandal, aloe, saffron and Tamala leaves. They proclaimed: "Ah! there has arisen a
desirable and excellent sprout of the seed of a gift made to the Tathāgata".That entire park
remained flooded knee-deep with that divine shower of flowers and powder.Then the Fortunate
One, the Fully Awakened One, Vipaśyin departed from that park and went to the forest
Bandhumatī.
