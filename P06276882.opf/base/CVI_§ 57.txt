[57] Then, with an excess of lustre like the unblemished orb of the autumn moon, like the sun
closely surrounded by a mass of twilight clouds, his figure shining intensely as if it were
the amassed splendour of the entire world, surpassing the radiance of the sun with his
own majesty, and surrounded by 500 Arhats, the Elder Ānanda arrived there, and remaining
just in the sky, spoke to the lad, Suvarṇavarṇa:

"Dear Child, very rarely do Tathāgatas arise in the world; teachers of gods and men, endowed
with vision, and with their passions overcome; (1)who make known the law which removes all
suffering, and which pertains to suffering, the arising of suffering, the overcoming of
suffering, and the Noble Eightfold Path, peaceful and leading to Nirvāṇa. (2)While this law
that dispels all suffering is being preached (people) are not reborn, having destroyed ignorance
with knowledge." (3)
