[97] Now, the Fortunate, the Fully Awakened One, Vipaśyin, with his mind composed and out of
compassion for the caravan leader Karṇa, came on foot through the middle of the street to
that ruined lying-in chamber of the caravan leader Karṇa.His body was radiant with a lustre
that was greater than that of the newly risen sun.He was like the full autumnal moon enveloped
in a streak of twilight cloud.He was, as it were, the Tree of Plenty from the pleasure-garden
of the city of the Gods.He was like a golden sacrificial post adorned with a creeper
of the coral tree of ambrosia.He was like an oil lamp placed upon a golden bowl.He
was like the mountain of jewels inlaid with many varied sprouts of jewels that had come forth.He
was like a royal goose powdered with the golden pollen of lotuses.He was like Airāvata
adorned with the pollen of the lotuses of the Mandākinī.He was like a lion plastered with
red orpiment.His figure was resplendent as if it were the heap of glory of the entire
world.The soles of his feet were brightly decorated with extremely well-formed chariot wheels.They
were very delicate and soft as freshly blossomed lotuses.They were adorned with the
śrīvatsa, svastika, nandyāvarta, vardhamāna, and fish symbols.The toe-nails of his feet
were very bright, being encompassed by rays red like the orb of the newly risen moon, and
were prominent, beautiful, well-set, of singular lustre and very clear.The toes were spread
out, rounded, long, well-formed, peerless and adorned with rows of tilaka marks upon their
nails, and the heels were soft, delicate, and agreeable to the touch like cotton.Shining
intensely in his glory like the sun in the vault of the sky, he illuminated this entire
world.
