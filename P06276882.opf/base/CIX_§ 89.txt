[89] Having heard that, the caravan leader’s wife embraced the boy Virūpa upon his neck, and
weeping aloud, said:

"Surely, you have committed a terrible sin, O son, in other births, whereby, though without
a fault, you are thus severely beaten by others. (1)

O shame! Alas! O!

Seeing this one that is extremely unpleasant, deprived of all happiness, wretched and begging,
no compassion arose in the mind. (2)Ah! smitten am I; I am ruined. Who, O son, broke the
bowl of you that, shattered in body, subsists by alms alone? (3)Setting aside compassion,
who, O son, broke the bowl today of you that, separated from father and mother art fallen
from the status of a householder? (4)Who broke the bowl of you, deprived of well-wishers
- friend, protector and parent -, and whose entire family is destroyed? (5)Alas, son, who
displayed his valour against you, sickly and wretched? Alas, you are smitten, dear son, by
the effect of your own previous actions. (6)Alas, son, gentle and good! Whose heart does
compassion not enter? Tell me, now, whose heart is hard as iron and stone? 2 (7)Alas, how
does the mind of man contrive to strike you down, wretched, smitten in a hundred ways, going
about for alms, and distressed by pain? (8)Exhausted by hunger and thirst, destitute of
all abundance, distressed by disease and pain, and smitten that you are, who strives to
smite you? (9)Seeing you miserable, sad-faced, weeping, tormented by hunger and with a parched
throat, who has not shown compassion to you? (10)How is it that you are beaten, O son,
by people bewildered by the intoxication of the pride of birth? Who, today, abandoned compassion
towards you that are extremely pained and overcome by disease? (11)Alas! even that
little food which you, tormented by hunger, collected by begging for alms, is now eaten
by dogs and crows. (12)Alas! Son, unfortunate one, what do I now do for you? Formerly having
committed sins, you are smitten by the consequences of evil deeds. (13)
