[118] On another day, when that monk, the preacher of the Law, was seated together with the
monks at the entrance to the cell and engaged in conversation, that Brahmin girl came and
said:"Noble ones, taking you to be monks we think this place is to be approached without apprehension.So,
how is it proper that I was forcibly held by this monk Ajita and deprived
of my maidenhood?"Thereupon, those monks shut their ears and said: "Sister, do not speak so.
It is not fit to be heard."Then, that monk, the preacher of the Law, said: "What impropriety,
what impropriety" and uttered censure of the monk Ajita.Finally, being repeated from
ear to ear, it was heard by the monk Ajita.On hearing it, he said: "Who said so?" Being
told: "This monk, the preacher of the Law",he went to where that monk, the preacher of the
Law, wasand said: "Venerable sir, what wrong have I done to you, that you thus utter my censure?Angry
at him, he uttered a harsh speech: "So evil a deed have you done that you deserve
the stake."On hearing that, it occurred thus to the monk Ajita: "This ascetic is grieved
and weakened".Thinking thus, he took his bowl and robes, put away the bedding he had used
and coming out of that monastery, set out.Seeing him set out, the monks, nuns and the
mass of people resident in that village, desirous of making him return, followed after him.
