[35] Thinking thus upon hundreds of thousands of misfortunes, faltering in his major and minor
Limbs,trembling, and with hesitant steps he somehow entered Rājagṛha. Hearing the noise
of the Lamentation of the mass of the populace,and following that noise of that Lamentation
he came to the street and saw the mass of the populace smitten by the sorrow of separation
and Lamenting as if the city had been attacked by demons.He asked a man that came his
way: "Sir, what is this?"Not knowing that he was the caravan leader, Divākara, he replied:
"The lad, Suvarṇavarṇa by name, is the son of the caravan leader Divākara.He is excessively
endowed with a wealth of handsomeness and like qualities.It is said that, alleging that
he killed the maiden Kāśisundarī in the park, he has been given up for execution without
even an investigation, and is being proclaimed (as to his crime and punishment) in the carriage-roads,
streets, junctions and cross-roads.Before long he will be taken to the great
cemetery and executed."Having heard that, the caravan leader, Divākara, smitten by the grief
of separation from his son, fainted forthwith and fell upon the ground.Then, his senses
regained after the sprinkling of water, he arose. His lotus-like face being filled with wave
upon wave of tears, excited, and looking at him (he asked): "Alas, by which path will
the lad Suvarṇavarṇa be taken?"and speedily set out along the middle of the street.As he looked,
he saw his wife, her hair hanging down, beating her breasts with both hands, with doleful
cries, uttering various lamentations and experiencing the sorrowful, sharp, harsh,
bitter and unpleasant pain arising from the separation from her son.He went up to her, his
faltering voice choked with intense sorrow and his eyes flooded with tears.
