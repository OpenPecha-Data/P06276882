[36] Having seen him and being smitten by the shaft of sorrow that had now become doubled, and
her lotus-like face become filled with wave upon wave of tears, she arose very quickly
and full of bewilderment threw herself before him.Then the caravan leader, Divākara, embraced
her as she lamented with doleful cries and made her stand up.She fell at his feet and
said:"Caravan leader, save me, save me. Grant me the boon of a son." She added:

"Now console me that am unfortunate and devoid of joy, that am being separated from my son,
that am weeping and greatly afflicted. (1)My Lord, he, at whose birth your joy was utmost,
your dear son, is today being taken away for execution. (2)Well-behaved, amiable, clever,
proficient in various sciences, and matchless in appearance, your Learned son is being Led
away. (3)Your family-stock is being cut off. The family-pillar is being broken up. The glorious
illuminator of the family, the Light, is being extinguished. (4)This the entirety
of the heart, this the bond of joy, this the nectar to the eyes of men, is being Led away
by the executioners. (5)All this is done (to the lad); this eye is removed; this, the heart,
named ’son’, been plucked out, is taken away. (6)Therefore, quickly let an effort be made
for the liberation of our son. Giving away even every possession, free both son and me.
(7)May your wishes be fulfilled; may your mind accomplish its hope. Would that I see him,
your son, alive." (8)
