[109] Then, the caravan leader Karṇa, his thoughts overcome by an intense surge of faith, observed:"I
obtained this wealth on account of the Fortunate One. What if I firstly conduct
the Fortunate One, the Tathāgata, Vipaśyin, into this house and make him partake of food together
with the host of disciples."Thinking thus, he invited the Tathāgata, Vipaśyin, together
with the company of disciples, into his house with great honour and having fed them
for seven days with food of excellent taste, fell at his feet and presented him with all requisites
for as long as he lived.
