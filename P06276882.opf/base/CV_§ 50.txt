[50] Then, the lad Suvarṇavarṇa observing the stake being erected upon the ground, became mindful
of his mother and, his heart melting with intense grief, began to shed tears:"Soon,
on hearing of her separation from me, what would be the condition of my mother?How will she
who, indeed, formerly on not seeing me even for half a watch, experienced great suffering,
sustain her life now, separated from me, her only son?Ah, Alas! Such an unfortunate one
am I, indeed, that, on account of me, my mother will suffer the pain of separation from me."Then,
those executioners fixed that stake in the ground and began to talk to one another:"Which
of us will place the lad upon the stake?"Thereupon, each one began to hold out a
pretext saying: "You do it (i.e. place the lad upon the stake),today, a headache worries me
excessively;me, an acute pain in my back; and me, an acute pain in my side."Not one of them
was willing to commit that crime.
