[100] Then, after making his earnest wish, the caravan leader Karṇa arose, and the Fully Awakened
One, Vipaśyin, returning thence, went to the forest of Bandhumatī.Now, the caravan leader
Karṇa was recognized by the merchants and caravan leaders of Bandhumatī.Thereupon, a
certain caravan leader said this to the citizens:"Sirs, we are not indifferent to the caravan
leader Karṇa who is impoverished";and spreading a cloth he added: "Sirs, it is possible
for one to be rescued by many, but not many by one.So, please place whatever any of you
wish to give away upon this cloth."When he said so, many hundreds of thousands of ornaments
such as necklaces, chains, bangles, bracelets, ear-rings, full and half necklaces and rings
were made over to him by many a person;as were also many hundreds of thousands of pairs
of garments of Kāśi, Dukūla, Koṭambaka, Kauśeya and Aparāntaka cloth, fine, of very great
expense and splendid.There arose for him at that very moment a very large heap of clothes
and ornaments.Then, the caravan leader Karṇa looked at that wealth, and said to his wife:"Good
lady, look, the shoot of the seed of a gift upon a good field has made its appearance."She,
too, becoming happy and joyous, bowed to the Fully Awakened One, Vipaśyin, and began
to take those clothes and ornaments into that ruined lying-in chamber.
