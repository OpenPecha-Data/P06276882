[88] Thereupon, the caravan leader’s wife together with that handmaid, and following behind
her, began to work for wages at the houses of others.But on account of the supremacy of the
demerit of the boy Virūpa, she obtained a lesser sum of money each day,till at last she
did not obtain anything though having set herself to work throughout the day till sunset,
and finally no one gave any work.Now, the caravan leader’s wife began to converse with her
handmaid:"Perhaps now no one will even give us work? Let us by all means go begging for alms."They
took a bowl and began to go begging for alms.When the boy Virūpa became able to
go about, his mother said: "Son, now, you eat after begging for alms yourself", and gave him
a bowl.He took that bowl and went to the street.Seeing him, whose skin was quite black
and unpleasant, who was extremely disfigured and had a body that was marred by the eighteen
blemishes, people turned their faces completely away from him and passed on with their faces
turned downwards.Those, to the door of whose houses he went, having smelled that very
disagreeable odour from his body closed their nostrils immediately, beat him with sticks,
gravel, etc., and drove him out, saying: "Quickly go away from here".He was like a restless
insect from the cesspool of the city, and wherever he went was beaten with sticks, stones,
gravel., etc.,and with his broken bowl, he came crying to his mother and becoming even
more grieved began to lament.Thereupon, seeing him and being distressed, she beat upon her
breasts and said:

"Ah, alas! Whom could you have offended, O son, that he should set aside compassion and strike
you, grieved as you are? (1)

Then, the boy Virūpa, sobbing aloud, said:

"They, to the door of whose houses I go a-begging, beat me with gravel, stones and sticks, etc."
