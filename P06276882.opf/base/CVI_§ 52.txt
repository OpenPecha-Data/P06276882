[52] It is heard that the Tathāgatas, the worthy Ones, the fully awakened Ones, are born in
the world at some time or other (i.e. rarely), just like the flower of the Udumbara; rarely
does there appear the expounding in the world of the law and the discipline made known by
the Tathāgata.The good luck of favourable birth is difficult to obtain. Birth as a human
being is difficult to obtain;(so are) rebirth in a noble region, possession of unimpaired
sense faculties, not being stupid, not being deaf and dumb, not talking with the hands, and
competence for the understanding of the meaning of the doctrines both well explained and
badly explained.Here I am destitute and will today cease to exist.By this my birth as a
human being, escaped from the eight inopportune births, will become fruitless.So, what shall
I do now?Does the Fortunate One, possessed of great compassion, the Awakened One, remain,
whom I could call to mind, and who would come and would, on account of his great compassion,
rescue me who am in this plight, helpless, without protection, without refuge, without
resort, devoid of light, and met with hardship, danger and distress?That Fortunate One,
too, has entered Nirvāṇa quite too soon, due to my misfortune.So, in this plight, whom shall
I now call to mind?Who will effect my rescue, having come here out of compassion, like
the Tathāgata?"Thinking thus, he became devoid of hope and began to tremble.
