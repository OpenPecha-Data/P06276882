[40] The executioners [in the meantime], making hundreds of excuses, were quite slowly wandering
along proclaiming the lad Suvarṇavarṇa as to his crime and punishment in the carriage-roads,
streets, junctions and cross-roads, and thinking:"Ah, alas! would that there were
some rescuers of the lad and thus would that we not commit a crime such as this."Then, those
royal servants arrived, drawn sword in hand, and spoke to the executioners as directed.They
added: "If you do not quickly drive him out from the city and execute him in the stipulated
manner, we shall execute you immediately".Having Looked at them that were very fierce,
with drawn swords ready in their hands, and that were like the servants of Yama, they
became terrified; then, frightened by the fear of death, they began to reflect:"Ah! Alas!
no one has rescued the lad, now he will have to be executed by us."Their eyes overflowing
with the water of tears and supervised by those royal servants, they began to drive the lad,
Suvarṇavarṇa, out from the city.
