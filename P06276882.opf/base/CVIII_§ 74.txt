[74] The Elder Ānanda spoke to that great mass of people:"Sirs, do not kill this man. I will
conciliate King Ajātaśatru".Thereupon, that great mass of people, having listened to the
words of the Elder Ānanda, released him.The Elder Ānanda, too, began to look at the king.The
king said: "What is it you command?"The Elder Ānanda replied: "Release this man, O Great
King".The king said: "I will release him on the condition that he, having obtained ordainment
in the well-enunciated doctrine and discipline, waits on the Elder Ānanda for as long
as he lives."The Elder Ānanda said: "Let it be so."He (Pracaṇḍa), too, unmercifully beaten
by that mass of people, and smitten by the pangs of severe pain remained unconscious.The
Elder Ānanda spoke to the venerable Suvarṇavarṇa: "Allay the pangs of pain from the body
of the minister, Pracaṇḍa, by a truthful resolve."Then, the venerable Suvarṇavarṇa, with
his mind set upon his earnest wish for the welfare of all beings, began to make a truthful
resolve:"By the truth, by the asseveration of truth that, though he was thus very harmful,
there arose not in me even the slightest enmity towards the minister, Pracaṇḍa,by that truth,
by that asseveration of truth, may the feeling of pain be allayed from his body."Immediately
after this truthful resolve, the feeling of pain passed away from the body of the
minister, Pracaṇḍa.His body restored to normal, he arose and, with respect begotten for the
teaching of the Fortunate One, went to the Elder Ānanda, fell at his feet and said:"Would
that I, O Elder Ānanda, obtain entry to the Order, ordination and the state of a monk in
the well-enunciated doctrine and discipline; would that I practise the holy life under the
guidance of the Elder Ānanda.He was entered into the Order by the Elder Ānanda, and was
instructed in such a way that, at that very moment, he obtained Arhatship by getting rid
of all the defilements.With Arhatship obtained, he rose into the vault of the sky and delighted
the minds of the populace with various miracles.Descending from the vault of the sky,
he made obeisance to the community of monks headed by the Elder Ānanda in due order and
sat on a side.
