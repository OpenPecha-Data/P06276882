[119] There arose remorse in that monk, the preacher of the Law, thinking: "I have not acted
correctly in that, for the sake of profit and honour, I have performed a deed conducive to
rebirth in evil states."Extremely dejected, he came out very quickly from that monastery,
thinking: "I will go and ask forgiveness". Greatly distressed in mind,his miserable face
wet with streams of tears, and crying out aloud like a young child, he fell at the feet of
the monk Ajita while those many hundreds of thousands of Brahmins and householders looked
on and began to confess his sin:"Pardon me, venerable Sir, for I untruthfully uttered your
censure, being foolish, deluded, ignorant, evil and overcome by profit and honour. Therefore,
show compassion and pardon me as I confess my sin."The monk Ajita, said: "Venerable
one, you are pardoned."After saying thus, extremely distressed in mind, seated near the foot
of a tree, cross-legged, and holding his body erect, he concentrated upon mindfulness.Remaining
just there, his thoughts melting with extreme emotion, striving, exerting, and endeavouring,
he comprehended this very five-partite wheel of rebirth as evermoving- and so
on up to - he became an Arhat worthy of the worship, esteem and homage of the gods including
Indra and Upendra.Like a royal goose with outstretched wings, he arose into the vault
of the sky, and winning the hearts of that great mass of people, began to display various
miracles.That monk, the preacher of the Law, seeing him in the vault of the sky, said: "Ah,
alas! I became angry at such a great sage" and fell upon the ground in a swoon.
