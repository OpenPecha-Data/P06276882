[25] Then, the minister, Pracaṇḍa, returned to the hall of justice and said to those royal officers:"Go,
Sirs, summon the executioners."They were summoned by them and the minister, Pracaṇḍa,
said to the executioners:"Sirs, this maiden Kāśisundarī was killed in the park by
this lad.Go, make firm the bonds on the hands behind the back of this ill-behaved manand,
with the sounding of a harsh-noised kettle-drum, having made proclamations at the points
for proclamations on carriage-roads, streets, junctions, and cross-roads,wend your way through
the southern city-gate. Taking him to the great cemetery,place him upon a stake. When
dead, place him together with the maiden Kāśisundarī upon the same pyre and cremate."Then,
those executioners looked at the lad Suvarṇavarṇa who was exceedingly handsome and, like
the peak of the mountain of purified gold, was radiant with extreme lustre. Become despondent,
they said to one another:"Sirs, though we are executioners, indeed, how could we kill
an excellent person such as this, the sight of whom is extremely difficult to obtain.In
every way, it is better that we should lose our lives than that we should, indeed, kill him."
