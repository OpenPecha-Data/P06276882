[107] The insight of Śakra prevails over the world below.It occurred to him thus: "This caravan
leader, Karṇa, has performed his duties towards the Fortunate, the Awakened One.Therefore,
he does not deserve to dwell in a grass-hut". Having observed thus, he addressed the
divinity Viśvakarman:"Go, Viśvakarman, create for the caravan leader Karṇa a house made of
the four precious materials and having four entrances and four stories."Then, Viśvakarman,
agreed with Śakra, the lord of the gods, and at that very moment came to the capital city
of Bandhumatī, and created an excellent house.It was provided with pillars of bricks made
of the four precious materials.It had lofty and splendid watch-towers, windows, turrets
and cornices, well laid out with subsidiary hoards and ivory pegs.It had four very tall stories.Its
doors were adorned with very beautiful portals.Above it were raised parasols, flags
and banners white as lotus-fibres, moon-beams, a heap of snow, or a mass of autumn clouds.Upon
it were cast clusters of garlands of cloth.It had become the abode, as it were, of
the entire ornamentation of that excellent city.Its entrance was adorned with coppery-red
mango sprouts, freshly sprouted and gleaming like gold.Its gates were adorned with jars
completely filled with cool water that had eight properties.It was being filled with many
thousands of treasures, replete with unlimited precious substances such as silver, cats’ eyes,
crystal, coral, sapphires and deep blue sapphires.It was also completely filled with
all other priceless materials and implements.
