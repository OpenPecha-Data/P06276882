[58] Just immediately after his words, the lad, Suvarṇavarṇa, rent asunder the mountain of the
false view of the existence of a personality, risen above with its 20 peaks, with the thunder-bolt
of knowledge and realized the fruit of "entry into the stream".Then, like a merchant
that had obtained a profit, like a husbandman endowed with a good crop,like a hero
victorious in battle, like having regained the kingdom of a universal monarch, the lad, Suvarṇavarṇa,
became full of great joy and delight.Remaining just there, with folded palms,
he began to extol the Elder Ānanda:

"Homage to you, Elder Ānanda; homage to you, best of Elders; homage to you, great sage, the
banner of the sons of the Victorious One. (1)Ah! your compassion is abundant; Ah! your compassion
is best; whence I have been rescued from this great hardship. (2)Appropriate is your
epithet "Protector of the World", which is wide-spread in the world, since I, distressed
with fear and destitute of a protector, was liberated by you, the protector. (3)You, the
moon of a sage, with the cool rays of kindness and compassion, have risen to refresh the
world distressed by the heat of suffering. (4)What I have obtained, thanks to you, a "good
friend"; that was done for me neither by mother nor by father nor even by friends. (5)Closed
are all evil ways. Laid open is the door to liberation. Dried up are all oceans, and passed
over are the mountains of bones. (6)Transmigration has neither beginning, middle nor
end; it abounds with the fear of suffering. I have been placed at its end by your virtues,
accompanied by wisdom (7)The shaft of false view, embedded since beginningless time, has
been drawn out; having obtained the best of physicians, feverless, I am comforted." (8)
