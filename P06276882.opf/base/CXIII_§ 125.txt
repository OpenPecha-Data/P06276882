[125] Thereupon, the caravan leader, Divākara, arose from his seat and put the upper robe over
one shoulder, placed his right knee upon the ground, and bowing with clasped hands in the
direction of the Elder Ānanda, thrice uttered a joyous utterance:"This, venerable Sir,
was done for me not by mother, not by father, not by king, not by deities, not by the beloved
of my own folk and kinsmen, not by the departed ones nor by ascetics and brahmins; but
only by the Noble Ānanda.The oceans of blood and tears have dried up."

"Worshipped in the world by the Daityas, men and gods; free from the inflictions of birth, decay
and death, O sage, whose sight is difficult to obtain even in thousands of existences,
today, the sight of you has been fruitful." (1)
