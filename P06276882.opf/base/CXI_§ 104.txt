[104] The caravan leader Karṇa said to his wife: "Good lady, where has our son, on account of
whom we had such misfortune, gone?"She replied: "He said ’I am going to the park’.Therefore,
go quickly, lest being distressed in mind, he kills himself there."The caravan leader
Karṇa said: "What is the name of our son and what is he like?"She replied: "Noble sir, he
is very ugly to look at and is called Virūpa."Then the caravan leader, employing a quick
gait, went to that park.There, he saw the boy, Virūpa, with his golden coloured body covered
with very expensive, fine and golden-yellow clothes.He was adorned with all ornaments,
quite enchanting to look at and radiant with extreme glory like a divine boy.Having seen him
he remarked: "Ah, fortunate is he of whom this is the son", and asked that boy:"Child,
whose son are you?" He replied:"There is the caravan leader Karṇa by name; I am his son."The
caravan leader Karṇa observed: "I am being rebuked by this boy".Thinking thus, his curiosity
greatly increased and looking at him without winking, he again asked that boy:"Ho, boy,
tell mo truly, whose son are you?"Virūpa replied: "What is there to doubt here? Truly,
I am the son of the caravan leader Karṇa".He remarked: "Alas! I am subjected to much ridicule",
and thinking thus he said:"Boy, I have heard that he is very ugly, but you are handsome.
So, by what means has this handsomeness of yours come about?"
