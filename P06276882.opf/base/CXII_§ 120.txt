[120] In the meanwhile, the Fortunate, the Perfectly Awakened One, Candra, his mind filled with
great compassion, thinking:"Would that, indeed, this monk, the preacher of the Law, not
vomit hot blood and pass away", came by magic power to that village.Then, with his hand
that was marked by the wheel, Svastika and Nandyāvarta, and was webbed, which was produced
by many hundreds of meritorious acts, and which brought comfort to the frightened, the Fortunate,
the Perfectly Awakened One, Candra, stroked that monk, the preacher of the Law, upon
his head.As soon as he was touched by the Fortunate One, that monk regained consciousness,
stood up and began to confess his sin.Now, at that time, the Fortunate, the Perfectly
Awakened One, Candra, spoke these verses:

"To every man that is born, an axe is born in his mouth, by which he cuts himself when speaking
bad language. (1)He who praises him who is to be blamed, and blames him who is to be praised,
accumulates evil with his mouth, by which evil he finds no joy. (2)Trifling is this
evil that one should lose his wealth by dice; here, this is a greater evil that one should
corrupt his mind against the Sugatas. (3)For they are a hundred thousand Nirarbudas, and
thirty-six and five Arbudas, to which hells he who blames an Ārya goes, having employed
his speech and mind sinfully. (4)Through corruption of the mind beings go to evil states of
existence; by serenity of mind beings go to good ones." (5)

Then, the Fortunate, the Perfectly Awakened One, Candra, having gladdened etc. that assembly
with a religious discourse, arose from his seat and departed.
