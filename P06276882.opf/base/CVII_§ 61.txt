[61] Then, that king having thus extolled the Elder Ānanda, arose and, his mind filled with
extreme joy, went quite quickly up to that stake.Stretching out his hands he himself brought
the lad, Suvarṇavarṇa, down from that lotus-seat with great affection as if he were his
own son that had been lost and found.Embracing him firmly he continued to repeatedly kiss
him on his head.His eyes filled with tears of joy, and looking at the lad, Suvarṇavarṇa,
with unwinking eyes, he said:

"What joy now increases on seeing you freed from this hardship, that was not for me formerly
on obtaining the kingdom. (1)Luckily, Son, do I now see this lotus-face of yours that surpasses
the lustre of the full moon and that has eyes like the petals of blue lotuses. (2)Luckily,
I see your body, charming with the colour of purified (gold), adorned with a wealth
of virtues and endowed with all limbs. (3)What unmerciful and evil-natured man by whom you,
the beloved of men, have been abandoned for execution, has betrayed his evil nature? (4)Say,
to whom is not dear this very wonderful figure, the speech that gives delight to the
ears, and the conduct that is disciplined? (5)Who has a hatred towards virtues, who is ever
disposed to wickedness; whose heart is similar to the hardness of diamond; who knows not
excellences? (6)His heart certainly consists of stone or has been made thoughtless or is
torn out, to whom you, Son, are not dear. (7)There has begun to be thrust a blazing thunderbolt
upon my head, or a sharp sword in my throat, or a spear, firmly, on my breast. (8)By
whom that has approved the execution of you, O beloved of all people, has the thunderbolt
of ill-fame been let fall upon me? (9)Alas! who by his order caused this dreadful deed
to be done to you? Who is persistent in his enmity towards me? To whom am I not dear? (10)Who
is he that is embraced by Death? To whom are his life-breaths not dear, that he has ordered
your execution? Please tell me quickly." (11)
