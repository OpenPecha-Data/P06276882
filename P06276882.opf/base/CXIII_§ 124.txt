[124] Then, the caravan leader Divākara, seeing that the company of monks headed by the Elder
Ānanda was comfortably seated, with his own hands refreshed them with pure and excellent
foods both hard and soft.When he saw that the company of monks had finished eating and that
their hands were washed and bowls taken away, he was desirous of clothing them with the
three robes at a cost of hundreds of thousands and looking upon the company of monks became
joyous at heart.Suvarṇavarṇa, now, realized his intention and said: "Father, do not worry
much.I will myself clothe the company of monks with the three robes of golden-yellow colour."Then,
at that very moment, the monk Suvarṇavarṇa removing again and again the golden-yellow
garments worth hundreds of thousands from his own body, presented sets of the three
robes to the three crores of monks according to their order of seniority.In the meanwhile,
many thousands of deities uttered exclamations and played various instruments of music.A
divine shower of flowers and aromatic powders and clothes was let fall.That mass of people
arrived there from the regions of the different quarters, as well as king Ajātaśatru, together
with the company of his harem, children, ministers, citizens and country-folk, seeing
such a miracle, their eyes dilated with amazement, thrice uttered a joyous utterance:"Ah,
the maturing of the fruit of merit.Ah, the efficacy of meritorious actions.Ah, the ripening
of the seed of a gift planted in a field worthy of gifts is unsurpassed.Therefore, what
wise man, indeed, observing such a ripening of the fruit of merit, would not bestow gifts
upon that field worthy of gifts?"Thus many hundreds of thousands of beings, with their
palms folded over their heads, shouted aloud: "Homage to the Awakened One".The Elder Ānanda,
then, performed the assignment of the profit from that work of merit.
