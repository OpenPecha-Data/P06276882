[99] After she said thus, the caravan leader reflected: "This bean-cake is small.How can I,
having been such in this very city, now make such a limited gift to the Fortunate One, while
the king, ministers, brahmins, householders and citizens look on.However, I will give it
wrapped in a leaf, thus I will not be found out." Thinking thus, he entered that ruined
lying-in chamber and began to look for a leaf, but could find none.Then that caravan leader,
even more dejected at heart, heaved a long and hot sigh, saying: "Ah, alas! So unfortunate
am I."Suddenly, having emerged from that ruined lying-in chamber, with a great surge of
faith, he put that bean-cake in the bowl of the Fully Awakened One, Vipaśyin.Having put
it, he fell at his feet and began to make an earnest wish: "O, Fortunate One, by this root
of merit, the giving of a meritorious gift, from this very birth onwards, may I never even
for a single day, be poor. May I be very rich, replete with ingredients of wealth and means."Immediately,
at the very moment the caravan leader Karṇa fell at the feet of the Fully
Awakened One, Vipaśyin, that most ugly emaciatedness of his disappeared and the Lustre of
his former complexion returned.
