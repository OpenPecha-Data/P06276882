[76] Then, that king, Ajātaśatru, having seen that very wonderful miracle capable of winning
over gods and men,his thoughts overcome by extreme faith, uttered a joyous utterance:"Ah,
the miracle; Ah! the wonder; Ah! the noble Ānanda has manifested the greatness of his virtues.
Ah! the greatness of the teaching of the Tathāgata has been made conspicuous.Ah! that
the fully Enlightened One, the Fortunate One, the Knowing One, the Seeing One, the Tathāgata,
the Arhat, as well as the Great Elder Mahakaśyapa entrusted that teaching to him, has
been made fruitful.Ah! the sun that was the Tathāgata having set, the quarters have (now)
been illumined by the sun that is the noble Ānanda with the mass of rays of his virtues.Ah!
the moon that was the Tathāgata having been swallowed by Rāhu, the lord of the Asuras,
in the form of Impermanence, the lotus-forests of those fit for conversion are (now) awakened
by the moon that is the noble Ānanda by the diffusion of beams that are his intellect.Ah!
the world tormented by the rays of the sun that is the severe pain of separation from
the Tathāgata, is refreshed by the great cloud that is the Elder Ānanda with the rain of
the nectar of his words.Ah! the wishes of the Tathāgata have been well fulfilled.Ah! the office
of helmsman to the teaching of the Tathāgata has been made conspicuous.Ah! the office
of responsibility for the teaching of the Tathāgata, has been revealed.Ah! the epithet "foremost
among disciples" has been made meaningful.Ah! the greatness of the virtues of the
omniscient one has been revealed by this very great wonder and through the efficacy of the
greatness of his own virtues, by bringing about the welfare of endless numbers of beings.Ah!
that magnanimous one has displayed his intention of returning a favour to that Fortunate
One of great kindness."
