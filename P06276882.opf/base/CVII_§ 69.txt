[69] Then the lad, Suvarṇavarṇa, disturbed in mind by the deficiencies of transmigration, sought
the permission of his parents, and falling down at the feet of the Elder Ānanda, said:-
"Elder, would that I obtain entry to the Order, ordination and the state of a monk in the
well-enunciated doctrine and discipline.May I practise the holy life in the well-enunciated
doctrine and discipline."He was entered into the Order by-the Elder Ānanda and was so
instructed that, at that very moment, he attained Arhatship by getting rid of all defilements.Having
attained Arhatship, he began to look at his successive former births.When he saw
that he was quite a great personage by reason of merit acquired by past deeds, it occurred
to him thus : -"I am mistaken if I should have understood that as I am thus distinguished
on account of merit.I would have performed meritorious actions to the fullest extent.So,
now too, in order to arouse in beings respect for meritorious actions, I would manifest
the greatness of my merit."Thereupon, he removed those clothes from his body. Immediately
after that there appeared others just like them.As he began to remove them again and again,
just so there appeared, for him, others again and again.He repeatedly removed them and
made a great heap of clothes in front of the Elder Ānanda.That great mass of people saw him
and the heap of those precious clothes, glittering like a heap of jāmbūnada gold covered
by the rays of the newly arisen sun as it were.Their thoughts overcome by extreme amazement,
they said:- "Ah! the wonder, Ah! the miracle, Ah! the greatness of meritorious deeds!Ah!
well has this magnanimous one performed meritorious deeds that indeed, although he removes
them continuously, there is no end to these very splendid clothes."He, then, presented
those clothes to his mother and father.The two of them in turn gave them, beginning with
the community of monks headed by Ānanda, to as many as formed that mass of people assembled
in the great cemetery.There, every being was presented with a pair of garmentsbut, on account
of the power of the merit of the monk, Suvarṇavarṇa, the heap of garments would not
indeed become exhausted.
