[2] Now, however, at that time there dwelt in the city of Rājagṛha a caravan leader, Divākara
by name. He was rich, had great wealth, and great comforts. His acquisitions were extensive
and large. Possessed of the wealth of Vaiśravaṇa, he rivaled him in wealth.He fetched
a wife from a similar familyand played, sported and cohabited with her.Although he played,
sported and cohabited with her, he had neither son nor daughter.Sonless and longing for a
son, he suffered griefwhen, among the gods of the Thirty-three, the five omens became manifest
for a certain deity exalted by reason of his merit.He surveyed the world adorned by
the arising of the Buddha, and desirous of Nirvāṇa, wished to obtain rebirth among men.
