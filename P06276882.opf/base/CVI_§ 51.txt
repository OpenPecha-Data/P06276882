[51] Then, having heard their conversation, and having looked at the stake fixed in the ground,
the lad Suvarṇavarṇa thought:"Soon, I will certainly cease to be",and distressed by the
deficiencies of transmigration, yearning for the path to deliverance, perceiving himself
to be devoid of joy, and eyes rolling with the despair of great fear, began to cry out:"Ah,
alas! now, after having obtained human birth [providing access to] the great festival of
the true law which is very difficult to he attained, I am to die without accomplishing my
object.Ah! again I will wander in the circuit of mundane existence.Again will I have to
dwell in the prison of transmigration.Again will I have to wander about in the wilderness
of transmigration.Again will I have to enter the great thicket of transmigration.Again will
I have to fall down upon the great precipice of transmigration.Again will I have to remain
in the middle of the mire of transmigration.Again will I have to be reborn in hells such
as Samjīva, Kalasutra, Samghata, Raurava, Maharaurava, Tapana, Pratapana and Avīci.Again
will I be reborn in different forms as elephant, ox, buffalo, hare, sarabha, deer, antelope
and cat.Again will I have to be reborn amongst departed spirits such as those having a
goitre in their necks, having such as urine, excrement, spittle and mucus for food, deprived
of hearing the words for food and drink, and filled with the melancholy of the great pains
such as of constant hunger and thirst.
