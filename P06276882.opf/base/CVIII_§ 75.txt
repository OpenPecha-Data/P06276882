[75] Then, having seen that very wonderful greatness of the Elder Ānanda, that assembly became
quite full of faith in the Elder Ānanda.Then, seeing that assembly thus full of faith in
their minds, the Elder Ānanda performed an exposition of the doctrine in such a way that
having heard it, many hundreds of thousands of beings obtained great distinction.Some obtained
the fruit of "entry into the stream", and some realized Arhatship.Some set their minds
on the awakening of the disciples, etc.,and [that whole assembly] was made inclined towards
the Buddha, intent upon the doctrine and devoted to the community of monks.The caravan
leader Divākara, together with his wife, realized the truths, and so did many hundreds of
thousands of deities.Thereupon, those deities full of faith in their minds, let fall a rain
of divine garmentsand played divine instruments, and the entire great cemetery was bestrewn
with a stream that was knee-deep with various divine flowers such as blue-lotuses, red-lotuses,
white water-lilies, white lotuses and māndāraka.
