[16] The minister Pracaṇḍa, too, waited a Long time for her in his park and, being exhausted,
entered the city at the time of sunset.He sent a messenger to her house asking Kāśisundarī:
"Why did you not come to my park today?"The maiden Kāśisundarī made an excuse saying:
"Sir, I did not come to the park, as a headache pains me much today."People being friendly,
hostile or neutral, one of the latter said:"A headache pains her not; but rather she had
gone to the park, to the presence of the lad Suvarṇavarṇa.I saw her returning from his park."On
hearing this, the minister Pracaṇḍa became full of anger and reflected:"I will do such
harm that, tomorrow, the maiden Kāśisundarī will cease to exist, so will the lad Suvarṇavarṇa,
too."Thus, of enmities, that begotten of women is despicable.His heart consumed by
the fire of wrath, he spent that night miserably.At daybreak he summoned a trusted man saying:"Take
your sword. I am going to the park outside Rājagṛha. I have some important business
there."Saying "So be it", that man took his sword and followed behind him.Thereupon,
the minister Pracaṇḍa departed from the city of Rājagṛha with that man and, entering the
park of the caravan leader Divākara, remained there.
