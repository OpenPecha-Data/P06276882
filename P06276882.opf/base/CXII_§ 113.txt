[113] "By this meritorious act, O protector, may I, from this birth onwards, be full of compassion,
intent upon the benefit of all beings. (1)Just as you endowed with the marks (of perfection)
obtained supreme awakening, even so, may I, too, attain the unequalled awakening.
(2)Just as you preach the Law, just as you have obtained omniscience, even so, may I, too,
thus obtain omniscience. (3)Even as you subdued Māra and set in motion the wheel of the
Law, may I, too, similarly subdue him and set in motion the wheel of the Law. (4)Just as
you, O protector, having yourself crossed over, help many beings across the ocean of transmigration,
even so may I, too, help them across, O best of sages." (5)

Then, the Fortunate One, the Perfectly Awakened One, Vipaśyin, in a voice that was lofty and
deep as that of a water-bearing rain-cloud, said aloud: "Good sir,

in this world, having overcome Māra absolutely, together with his army, formidable and springing
forth from all sides, you will indeed be a teacher upon earth, Sarvārthasiddha [the One
whose every purpose has been accomplished] by name, and of great might." (6)
