[44] It occurred to him: "Why do I despair? Let me call to mind the Enlightened, the Fortunate
One, the sole kinsman to the whole world, of great compassion.Indeed, that Fortunate One
is the protector of the helpless, the defender of the defenceless, the refuge of the refugeless,
and the last resort for those without one.Thus, indeed, were many beings that had
come upon misery, danger and affliction delivered from those various great perils by that
Fortunate One.Likewise, merchants in the middle of the ocean, terrified by fear of sea-monsters
and fish, were saved from that mortal fear just by the mere recollection (of him).Similarly,
his mother was saved from that fear of being deprived of her life when about to
be smitten by the killer of many a man, Aṅgulīmāla, with his sword raised impetuously.Likewise,
having, on account of the effectiveness of enmity continuing from a previous birth,
been offered as food, on account of (his) killing numerous hundreds of thousands of beings,
to the demon, with the fire of his ferocity flaring up and with his face that was frightening
both on account of the terrible tusks that were hideous, long and sharp, as well as
the tongue that licked about at the saliva that flowed out of greed for the enjoyment of the
taste of human flesh, Hastaka Āṭavaka 2, who was just on the point of being consumed (lit.
remaining in the vicinity of his mouth), was saved from that mortal fear.That Fortunate
One is capable of delivering my son from this danger.Let me call to mind that same Fortunate
One, who is of great compassion, and most affectionate by nature."He asked a lay-devotee
that was near him: "Where does the Fortunate One now live?"Then, that lay devotee, having
called to mind that Fortunate One, with his voice faltering on account of being choked
with tears, said: "O caravan leader,

that great teacher, the sole kinsman of all the world, who was the caravan leader of the world,
and the giver of comfort in the world, has entered into Nirvāṇa. (1)In the world, that
victorious one, who was the light to those without a light, the refuge and the goal, the
lamp, is extinguished as it were through the loss of oil." (2)
