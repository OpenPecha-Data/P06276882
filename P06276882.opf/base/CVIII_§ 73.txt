[73] came thence through the sky above, by magic power, to the great cemetery and, having bowed
in due order to the community of monks headed by the Elder Ānanda, sat down on a side.King
Ajātaśatru heard that the minister, Pracaṇḍa, who was jealous by nature had done this
and that injury to the maiden Kāśisundarī in the parkand had laid false accusations against
Suvarṇavarṇa, who, though faultless, was abandoned to execution.Having heard thus, his
eyes filled with intense anger, he addressed his courtiers:"Sirs, how, indeed, should this
evil-minded one have judged thus? I disown the minister, Pracaṇḍa, in every way."The minister,
Pracaṇḍa, too, was in that very gathering.Now, having heard these words of the king,
the minister Pracaṇḍa, his eyes rolling on account of despair at the fear of death, and trembling
in all the limbs of his body, suddenly arose and attempted to flee.As he was hated
by the populace, many hundreds of thousands of beings ran forth towards him and,being thus
surrounded on all sides, he was captured by the great mass of people. Having captured him,
they began to beat him with hard slaps, kicks, etc.While being beaten, he was smitten
by the pangs of severe pain and began to cry out:"Noble Ānanda, save me that am helpless,
without protection, without a refuge, without resort, and devoid of light. Grant me my dear
life."
