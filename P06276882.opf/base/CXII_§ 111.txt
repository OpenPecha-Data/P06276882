[111 ] Moreover: No one but the Buddha has such an excellent body adorned with every excellence
of perfect figure and charm. (1)There is no expounder equal to the Buddha; there is no
wise man equal to the Buddha; there is no knower equal to the Buddha; there is no sage equal
to the Buddha. (2)There is no worthy receptacle equal to the Buddha; there is no one possessed
of happiness equal to the Buddha; there is no one that is subdued who is equal to
the Buddha; there is no lord equal to the Buddha. (3)There is no teacher equal to the Buddha;
there is no father equal to the Buddha; there is no kinsman equal to the Buddha; there
is no friend equal to the Buddha. (4)He is free from selfishness, free from intoxication,
free from fear, free from fatigue, and free from evil. He has crossed the wilderness of
existence, has no rival, and is free from illness. (5)Charming, tranquil, pure, subdued, mindful,
possessed of powers, self-controlled, and benefactor to all beings, there is no other
equal to the Buddha. (6)In short, let it therefore be duly understood that in perfect
and distinct virtues there is not the like of the Buddha, even in the three worlds." (7)
