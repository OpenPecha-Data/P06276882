[77] His thoughts overcome by the surge of faith in the Elder Ānanda,the king then went up to
the Elder Ānanda and fell prostrate at his feet.Having arisen, he placed both knees upon
the ground and his body roughened by horripilation on account of faith, with folded palms,
began to praise the Elder Ānanda: -

"Homage to you, best of men; homage to you, Ocean of learning; homage to you, O very wonderful
and imponderable one, caretaker of the teaching of the Victorious One. (1)Ah, the greatness
of the teaching of the Buddha has been well manifested by you, today, performing this
imponderable and wonderful service to the world. (2)That teaching which was entrusted to
you by the Fortunate One and by the wise and noble Kaśyapa, has now been made fruitful. (3)Performing
this great, very wonderful and imponderable service to beings, the greatness of
the virtues of the Omniscient One is, today, mirrored by you. (4)What is wonderful if the
Awakened One, likewise, performed service to beings; for, indeed, he is omniscient, all-seeing
and full of great compassion. (5)This I consider more wonderful that you, being a disciple,
did great service to beings, as did the greatly Compassionate One. (6)Ah! with ease
have I obtained profit; so, too, these people of Magadha, upon the welfare of whom that
are so careless, you are ever intent. (7)This teaching was fittingly entrusted by the Tathāgata
to you, by whom, as by the Sugata, a very great wonder has been performed today." (8)Thereupon,
amazed at the greatness of the virtues of the Elder Ānanda, he called to mind
the Fully-Awakened One and immediately did homage to him. (9)"Homage be to you, Great Hero,
Fully Awakened One, best of men; you, of whom even a disciple is thus ever intent upon
the welfare of beings. (10)His greatness has been highly and well proclaimed by the Tathāgata;
as, with you, we think this assemblage of people not deserted." (11)
