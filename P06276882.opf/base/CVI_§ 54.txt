[54] Then, in the meantime, his loins girt in order to accomplish the welfare of the entire
world, observing the activities of numerous beings, his thoughts upon their welfare, and deeply
moved, likewise, the Elder Ānanda, the Magnanimous One, out of compassion saw with his
divine eye, the lad Suvarṇavarṇa in that predicament.His thoughts impelled by compassion,
illuminating the sphere of the world with divine radiance, and surrounded by five hundred
Arhants,he immediately arose by his magic power into the sky and, filling the vault of
the sky as if with masses of twilight clouds,his body shining intensely as if it were the
amassed glory of the whole world, set out towards the cemetery.King Ajātaśatru, remaining
in the upper storey of the palace, saw the Elder Ānanda together with a large company of monks,
ensconced by them in the shape of a half-moon, and up in the sky by his magic power
going towards the great cemetery, ornamenting the sky as if with a mass of twilight clouds.And
having seen him, it occurred to him thus: "Surely, the Elder Ānanda has come for the
sake of the lad Suvarṇavarṇa, and on his account will be desirous of preaching the very wonderful
and marvellous law.I, too, shall go to the great cemetery."Then, having bowed immediately
to the Elder Ānanda and his retinue and having sought refuge, he descended from the
upper storey of his palace quite quickly and, with a retinue of many hundreds of thousands
of beings, set out to the great cemetery simply on foot.Just at that time, the executioners
were threatened by those royal servants with their weapons drawn:"Why do you thus delay?
Place this lad quickly upon the stake."Then, those executioners, being terrified, began
to cast (the lad upon the stake) after saying: "We shall place the lad Suvarṇavarṇa upon
the stake."The lad, Suvarṇavarṇa, distressed in mind at the evil of transmigration, and devoid
of hope, began to cry out:"Ah! Alas! I have been abandoned by the Noble Ānanda, since,
indeed, he has not paid attention and rescued me."
