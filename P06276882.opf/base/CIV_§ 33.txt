[33] Then again, with folded palms, making a request of the citizens, she said, bewildered at
heart:

"Alas! I am smitten, devoid of joy! What is this that is happening to me! Is this a dream or
delusion, or is it an aberration of the mind? (1)That virtuous lady, her mind distracted
by intense sorrow for her son and lamenting incessantly, requested the citizens: (2)[Is it
that] he is undisciplined or disfigured and not dear to my heart, that you would thus disregard
my son as he is being taken away! (3)If you have compassion or a partiality for virtues,
may the citizens act in such a way that I will see my son. (4)Today he was not anointed
by me with unguents such as sandal nor was he adorned in manifold ways with the rocana
orpiment, bracelets and coloured marks. (5)Today, he was not adorned by me with ornaments
such as bracelets, nor was he embraced without reserve, nor given many kisses. (6)He did
not circumambulate and show reverence to me, today. How indeed, Sirs, is my son being taken
away in this very fashion? (7)Empty are all the quarters for me today. My body trembles,
my heart burns, too; and my mind is stupefied. (8)He is taken away quite quickly by the cruel
executioners. Alas! Alas! never again will I see my son, the darling of my heart. (9)Surely,
I have committed a grave sin in a previous life that I am consumed thus with grief
for my son, like dry grass by fire." (10)By the truth that I have no eveil thoughts even
with regard to my enemies, thereby let my son be liberated from this calamity." (11)
