[11] Now, the lad Suvarṇavarṇa, having heard these stanzas, terrified by the circuit of mundane
existence and seeing the advantage of Nirvāṇa,worshipped that monk and asked:"Noble one,
what is it?" The monk replied: "Sir, it is the word of the Awakened One."On hearing that,
there arose in him great faith in the teaching of the Fortunate One, as well as a desire
for ordination and for Liberation.Then, paying respect to that monk and falling at his feet,
he said: "Noble one, I wish to be ordainedand it therefore behooves you to show compassion
and ordain me."The monk asked: "Sir, have you been given permission by your parents?",and
he replied: "I have not." The monk said: "Go now, sir, seek your parents’ permission.
We do not, indeed, ordain a person that has not been given his parents’ consent."He replied:
"I shall do so."
