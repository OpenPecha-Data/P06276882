[66] He praised the Elder Ānanda thus, and seeing manifest the fruit of action, reflected:-
"It is not proper for me that I, seeing manifest the desirable and undesirable fruit of action,
should again dwell in a household."He fell down at the feet of the Elder Ānanda and
said:"Noble One, would that I obtain entry to the Order, ordination and state of a monk in
the well-enunciated doctrine and discipline. May I practise the holy life in the presence
of the Elder."He was entered into the Order by the Elder Ānanda and was so instructed that
he attained Arhatship by getting rid of all defilements.
