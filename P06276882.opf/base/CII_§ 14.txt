[14] Later, on another occasion, the maiden Kāśisundarī, adorned with all ornaments, departing
from Rājagṛha proceeded to the park of the minister Pracaṇḍa.The lad Suvarṇavarṇa, too,
departing from the city of Rājagṛha went to his own park.The maiden Kāśisundarī saw the lad
Suvarṇavarṇa who was exceedingly handsome, charming and pleasant. Endowed with all the
major and minor limbs, he was possessed of an excellence of complexion, the colour of purified
gold.He captivated the eyes and minds of all people. His body was covered with golden-yellow
garments. Having seen him, it occurred to her thus:"Ah! the nobility of his figure!Ah!
the excellence of his complexion! Fortunate is that woman whose husband he will become."Become
exceedingly attracted towards him, she reflected:"Unfortunate is that woman who
does not enjoy amorous sport with such a man.We make a living by the beauty of our figure,
and are common to all men. This lad is in the bloom of youth.What if I so entice him that
there would ensue a union between him and myself."She stood before him and began to show
intimations of her desire.But that magnanimous one, as he was by very nature averse to pleasures
and as he was prone to Nirvāṇa, did not pay heed to her.
