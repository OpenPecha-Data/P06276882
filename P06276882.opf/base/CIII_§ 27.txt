[27] The minister, Pracaṇḍa, again ordered them harshly saying: "Why do you delay?"Frightened,
they went near himand, their eyes filled with tears and trembling, seized and tied him,
hands behind, with that same golden-yellow garment (he wore).Seeing him firmly tied, hands
behind, the entire mass of people at the hall of justice, except the minister, Pracaṇḍa,
their thoughts moved by the distress of separation from him, began to shed tears:"Ah, alas!"
this lad, the sight of whom is difficult to obtain, will soon cease to be."He was then
taken to the street by the executioners. Just at that moment, an uproar arose and upon hearing
it, a mass of people assembled there, the inhabitants of Rājagṛha and those that had
come from the countries (of the) various quarters, women, men, boys and girls.Seeing the
lad, Suvarṇavarṇa, hands tied firmly behind him, they became distracted in mind and began
to ask excitedly: "Sirs, what is this?"Their voices faltering on account of being choked with
tears, those executioners then said, lamenting:"Sirs, alleging he killed the maiden, Kāśisundarī,
the lad, Suvarṇavarṇa, has been given up for execution and is being proclaimed
[as to his crime and punishment] in the carriage-roads, streets, junctions and cross-roads.Before
long, he will be taken to the great cemetery and executed."
