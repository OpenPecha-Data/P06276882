[5] Later, that deity, fallen from the World of the Thirty-three gods, descended into the womb
of the wife of that caravan leader, Divākara, in the city of Rājagṛha.From the very time
he descended into her womb, there appeared on the body of that wife of the caravan leader
a great excellence of complexion and a pleasant fragrance began to issue.There are five
peculiar qualities in every intelligent woman.What are the five: she knows the man who is
impassioned and the man who is dispassionate; she knows the proper time and the menstrual
periods; she knows when the embryo has descended; she knows from whom the embryo has descended;
she knows whether it is a boy or a girl,if it is a boy it remains keeping to the right
of the womb,if it is a girl it remains keeping to the left of the womb.Greatly delighted,
she informed her husband:"Congratulations to you, honoured sir, I have become pregnant.
As the embryo remains keeping to the right of my womb, it will surely be a boy".On hearing
this, he too, greatly delighted, stretching high out the upper part of his body and extending
his right hand, uttered a joyous utterance:"Would that I, indeed, see the long wished
for face of a son; may he be worthy of me and not misbegotten; may he perform his duties
towards me; having been sustained may he sustain me in return; and may he receive my inheritance.Would
that my family line be long lasting. After we have passed away, he will make
gifts, be it little or be it much, perform meritorious acts, and assign the profit in our
name, saying: "Let it follow those two as they go, wherever they are reborn."
