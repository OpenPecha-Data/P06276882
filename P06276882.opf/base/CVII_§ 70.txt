[70] Thereupon, the monk, Suvarṇavarṇa, soared up into the sky and went to the city of Rājagṛha
by magic power.In the middle of the crossroads he made a large-sized heap of golden-hued
clothes, removing them repeatedly from his body.Filling the city of Rājagṛha with his voice,
he said:- "Sirs, I have relinquished these clothes. Please take as many as are of use
to any of you".On hearing this, at that very moment, many hundreds of thousands of beings
assembled there.They saw at the cross-roads in the middle of the city, the very large-sized
heap of those golden-yellow clothes, shining like a heap of jāmbūnada gold, beaten upon
by the rays of the sun, and also the venerable Suvarṇavarṇa in the vault of the sky, shining
with extreme glory like the peak of a mountain of purified gold.Seeing them, that great
mass of people, their thoughts overcome by extreme amazement, and their lotus-like faces
becoming filled with ripples of waves of extreme delight, reflected:- "Ah! the wonder; Ah!
the miracle! What is it, now, that this magnanimous one has performed, whereby he is thus
possessed of great power and of great might.Should we know, we too would perform it, whereby
we too would thus be possessed of great power."Their desire aroused, but wavering with
doubt, they began to talk to one another.It occurred to them: "This one is thus magnanimous,
possessed of great power and of great might, has fulfilled his vows and is endowed with
divine knowledge. Let us ask just him."Thereupon, that mass of people, their eyes dilated
with extreme amazement, with folded palms, and their gaze fixed upon the vault of the
sky, bowed to the venerable Suvarṇavarṇa, and said in unison:

- "Highly fortunate one, you are endowed with the divine eye of wisdom. It behooves you to tell
us that whereby you are thus exalted. (1)It behooves you to explain to us that whereby
one attains abundance of wealth and of virtues in this world and in the next." (2)
