[64] On hearing that, the maiden Kāśisundarī, in whom had risen great esteem for the Elder Ānanda,
began to experience extreme faith.Then, the maiden Kāśisundarī, having recollected
the park and the minister Pracaṇḍa, distressed in mind, her eyes rolling in despair on account
of the fear of death, and taking the situation to be another like that, began to bewail
womanhood:"Alas, womanhood that is indeed very inferior and is the abode of all misery,on
account of which I am in this situation."Distressed in mind, she arose quickly and, taking
a garment went up to the Elder Ānanda and presented that single garment to the Elder Ānanda.She
fell at his feet, and, having first called to mind the virtues of the Elder Ānanda,
began to make a truthful resolve with an intense surge of faith:- "By the truth, the asseveration
of truth, that you, O sage of Videha, have become the foremost of the pupils of
the Buddha;that you are superior to the best, distinguished, most excellent, supreme and
unsurpassed;that you are the elephant of the disciples, the lion of the disciples, the bull
of the disciples, the thoroughbred of the disciples,the red-lotus of the disciples, the
white water-lily of the disciples, the white-lotus of the disciples;the charioteer of the
disciples, the caravan leader of the disciples;the moon of the disciples, the sun of the
disciples;the jewel of the disciples and the crest-jewel of the disciples;that you are the
helmsman of the teaching and the one that looks after the teaching;that you are a worthy
one, that has exhausted the depravities, has performed his business, done what was to be done,
has laid off the burden, has achieved his own end, whose bonds of existence are destroyed,
and whose mind is freed through perfect knowledge, and that you are of great power,
of great might, exceedingly powerful and worthy of great gifts,by this truth, and asseveration
of truth, this very day may my feminine organs disappear and male organs appear."Then,
immediately after this truthful resolve was made, her feminine organs disappeared and male
organs appeared.She became a man, handsome, charming, and pleasant. His body was adorned
with diverse clothes and ornaments.For him there began to fall from the vault of the sky
a divine, variegated and pleasant shower of clothes.Now, too, by that falling shower of clothes,
the orb of the sky was so covered that at that moment in that great cemetery the rays
of the sun could not be discerned.Thereupon, having observed that great wonder, able to
win over gods and men, the greatness of the virtues of the Elder Ānanda, many crores of
millions of hundreds of thousands of deities that were in the sky let out exclamations:"Ah,
the marvel! Ah, the great wonder! Ah, the greatness of the virtues of the Elder Ānanda!Ah,
the exaltedness!Ah, what an extremely pure field worthy of gifts, wherein, indeed, by the
mere presentation of a single garment, immediately after her earnest wish, the feminine
organs of the maiden Kāśisundarī disappeared, male organs appeared, and there was a manifestation
of power such as this."Then those deities, their minds full of faith, let fall a
divine shower of flowers. Divine music was also played.
