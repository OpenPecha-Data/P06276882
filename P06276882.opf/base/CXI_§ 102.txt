[102] Now, there is nothing that is not known, not seen, not understood or not comprehended
by the Awakened, the Fortunate Ones.The Fully Awakened One, Vipaśyin, saw with the pure, superhuman
and divine eye of an Awakened One, the lad Virūpa who was thus pained.Seeing him
and being moved by great compassion, he went to that park by magic power, and discharged
a radiance from his body.The rays of compassion of the Fortunate One accumulated over hundreds
of thousands of kalpas were discharged.Indeed, at the mere touch of them, what feeling
of bodily pain Virūpa had, vanished, and that pain of hunger and thirst was allayed.Getting
up immediately, he saw the Fully Awakened One, Vipaśyin, a sight difficult to obtain within
hundreds of thousands of crores of niyutas of kalpas, radiant with his body resplendent
with the thirty-two marks of a great being.With the sight of him, there arose in him great
faith towards the Fully Awakened, the Fortunate One, Vipaśyin.He was covered in a piece
of cloth a cubit in length and the colour of tumeric.Overcome by faith, he took it off
his body and with a great surge of faith immediately put it upon the Teacher, Vipaśyin, together
with a Karṇikāra flower.The Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Fully Awakened, the Fortunate
One, Vipaśyin, exercised his power in such a way that the piece of cloth being transformed
to the size of his body, he caused it to cover his body.The Karṇikāra flower, too, having
become the size of a cart-wheel, stood above him like an umbrella.Having seen that, very
great faith arose in the lad Virūpa.With a great surge of faith, he fell at the feet of the
Fully Awakened One, Vipaśyin, and in a loud voice, began to make an earnest wish:

"By this gift, here in this world, O best of Men, may I cast aside ugliness and obtain handsomeness
from today onwards. (1)Of a golden complexion and dressed in clothes of a golden hue,
may there he the fragrance of sandal and blue-lotus from my body and my mouth. (2)May
I he a Fully Awakened One, possessed of a sheen of golden hue, captivating the mind of all
the world, freed from all disease and a master of the purport of all the śastras; (3)meaningful
in every word, free from all that is evil; all-supreme, and all-seeing, and adorned
in all manner; (4)all aims accomplished, devoted to all beings, possessed of all pure virtues,
glorious, endowed with all wealth and happy." (5)
