[30] A maid from the house of the caravan leader Divākara came to the street.She heard of these
events and, crying and beating her breasts, went home in all haste. She approached the
mother of the lad Suvarṇavarṇa, and threw herself before her.The mother of the lad Suvarṇavarṇa
became alarmed and asked:"What do you say, maid?"Crying aloud, she began to relate:"Noble
lady, the lad Suvarṇavarṇa, his hands tied firmly behind him, is being guarded by the
executioners.Alleging that he killed the maiden, Kāśisundarī, in the park, he has been
given up for execution even without investigation, and is being proclaimed (as to his crime
and punishment) in the carriage-roads, streets, junctions and cross-roads.Before long, he
will be taken to the great cemetery and executed.
