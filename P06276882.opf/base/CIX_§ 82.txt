[82] Even as that embryo developed, just so, whatever collection of goods the caravan leader
Karṇa had there, whether in the shops, or in the fields or in foreign regions, some was burnt
by fire, some was taken away by thieves, and servants ran away with some.When the time
was ripe, the wife of the caravan leader gave birth and a boy was born who was dark of skin
and extremely disfigured.His body was marred by the eighteen blemishes.The smell that
emanated from his body and mouth was so very unpleasant that, upon smelling it, the attendants
in that house turned their faces away.Just as soon as that boy was born, a fire arose
in that house, consuming it as well as all their wealth.The caravan leader’s wife somehow
got out of that house with her child.When the fire consumed that house and all their wealth,
and became extinguished of its own accord,the caravan leader’s wife entered the partly
ruined and destroyed lying-in chamber, spread a piece of cloth upon the ground and put the
boy to sleep upon it.Heaving a long and hot sigh she called to mind the caravan leader Karṇa
and began to cry:"Ah, alas, such reversal is at hand."
