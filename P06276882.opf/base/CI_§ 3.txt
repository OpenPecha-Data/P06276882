[3] Śakra, the lord of the gods, saw that deity who was destined to die and who, having surveyed
the world adorned by the arising of the Buddha, being desirous of Nirvāṇa, wished to
obtain rebirth among men. Having seen him, he approached that deity and said:"If you, dear
friend, wish to obtain rebirth among men, do so in the womb of the wife of the caravan leader
Divākara in the city of Rājagṛha."He replied: "Kauśika, that caravan leader is an unbeliever;
he has no faith in the teaching of the Buddha."Śakra said: "Dear friend, you obtain
rebirth (as directed), and I will act in such a way that that caravan leader will have
faith in the teaching of the Buddha."The deity replied: "Kauśika, if that caravan leader,
together with his wife, should take refuge in the Three Jewels for the length of his life,
then I will obtain rebirth in the womb of his wife."
