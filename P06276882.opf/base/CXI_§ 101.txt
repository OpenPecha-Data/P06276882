[101] The lad, Virūpa, too, entered that park belonging to his father and, his mind tormented
by the pain of hunger, and grieving again and again over that great deformity of his, reflected:"I
am a doer of evil. Great hardship is my lot. I am greatly deformed and inauspicious
to look at. What is the use of my living?By all means I will kill myself." Thus depressed
in mind, he immediately climbed upon the topmost branch of a Pātāla tree.The branch of
the tree broke, and immediately falling down with it he remained afflicted by pain.
