[65] Thereupon, the man, Kāśisundara, in consequence of the greatness of the virtues of the
Elder Ānanda, perceived the immediate ripening of the fruit of actions, that was very attractive
and was in accordance with his own desires.His thoughts were overcome by extreme amazement,
extreme happiness and joy arose in him, and his body became roughened on account
of the hair that bristled with joy. He arose and placing both knees upon the ground, began
to praise the Elder Ānanda, with folded palms: -

"Homage to you, rare one, imponderable one, amassed with very pure virtues; you, by whom life
was thus given today to me that had no protector. (1)If you, with eyes of pure knowledge,
had not been my protector, how would I have my life-breaths remaining? You, O sage, are
the saviour of my life. (2)Oh, the greatness of your virtues; Oh, your desire for the welfare
of beings, that (this) person was thus rescued by you from a terrible danger! (3)Oh! your
worthiness for receiving gifts, very pure and very rare; even the gift of a single cloth
to whom acquires such high value. (4)Thus, having given to you, Great Sage, a single garment,
I obtained immediately the auspicious fruit (of action) that was in accordance with
my desires. (5)That womanhood which, methinks, is, as it were, a support of great evils,
too, has this very day been abandoned by me, and manliness has been acquired. (6)That is this
divine likeness here, adorned with divine ornaments; there falls, also, a very charming
shower of garments from the sky. (7)They indeed who do not pay homage to such a virtuous
and excellent field, are unfortunate, deceived now by the enemies that are the defilements
such as delusion." (8)
