[39] The minister, Pracaṇḍa, having heard it became angry and said:"What has not been investigated
in this matter that it has to be investigated again, and that you should say the royal
treasury will be augmented?How is it that we would augment the royal treasury with wealth
illegitimately obtained?Nor have you understood the wish of the king.In every way, making
use of the people of Vaiśālī, you are surely desirous of doing harm to this king in that
by this plan you wish to utter blame of this king, saying"The king indeed acts unlawfully
since by not investigating, he destroys the people".He rebuked them and having done so-
he had four men like the servants of Yama, of very dreadful deeds, of pitiless disposition
on account of constant habit, and devoid of compassion - he summoned them and said:"Go quickly,
supervise the executioners,and address them in my name saying: "Quickly drive him
out from the city and execute him in the stipulated manner.Nor is he to be released at the
request of anyone other than myself or the king.It will be good for you to act accordingly,
otherwise I shall inflict severe punishment upon you".Those royal servants having assured
him saying "It shall be so", set out, sword in hand.
