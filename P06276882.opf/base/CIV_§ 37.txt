[37] Then, the caravan leader, Divākara, though smitten by the sorrow and pain of separation
from his son, having summoned all his courage with his mind, addressed the citizens, with
folded palms:"O! citizens! please listen. How, indeed, is it proper for you to disregard
this impending calamity of mine?How is my boy, though of renowned excellence, taken away for
execution through the middle of the city even while you look on, as if in a forest, without
investigating?How do you remain without much anxiety?How is it that a way of preventing
(this calamity) is not thought of?How do you not strive for the liberation of my boy?"They
replied: "Caravan leader, such is this lad possessed of excellence, that this is not a
calamity to you alone, but also to us all. However, we do not see a means of setting the
boy free.Hence we remain dejected thus."The caravan leader, Divākara, said:"Sirs, you know
very well that this boy is extremely compassionate, magnanimous, a Lover of righteousness,
dear to Living beings.He is incapable of even giving rise to the thought of such a criminal
act, still less of committing it.Therefore, please begin an effort for an investigation
of the boy.If the lad is investigated he would indeed be freed from this calamity.You are
honest and impartial to all men. Therefore, should you report (this matter), no fault whatsoever
is seen.Not otherwise, will compassion he shown towards me.Your love, too, on account
of virtue will be made manifest.Therefore, take compassion and go, let the king or his
ministers be informed.Perhaps, being desirous of wealth they will not think otherwise of
your words even as they are quite appropriate.I am extremely distressed by the separation
from my son.Giving even all my wealth this favour should be done that the boy be properly
investigated."
