delighted that assembly including the king bowed to by those hundreds of thousands of deities
and by hundreds of thousands of beings resident in Rājagṛha, he rose from his seat and

path of the Great Vehicle. May whatever merit lies herein accrue towards the attainment
of supreme wisdom by the entire multitude of beings headed by teachers, instructors and
parents!
