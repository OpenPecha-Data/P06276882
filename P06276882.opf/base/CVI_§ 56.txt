[56] Then, having heard that from the Elder Ānanda, the lad Suvarṇavarṇa, as if having lost
and regained his life, become consoled, the hair of his body bristling (with great joy), and
with his gaze fixed upon the vault of the sky, remained with his mind concentrated upon
the Elder Ānanda.Thereupon, those royal servants said to those executioners:"Sirs, here are
monks coming through the sky.As they are compassionate, perhaps, having come, they will
cause an obstruction;therefore, quickly place the lad upon the stake,lest great harm befall
you on account of transgressing the king’s orders."Then, those executioners, frightened
by the apprehension of the destruction of the lives of their children, wives, relations and
kinsmen, lifted up the lad Suvarṇavarṇa and began to place him upon the stake.Thereupon,
the Elder Ānanda willed, immediately, in such a way that there appeared above that stake
a lotus of great dimensions, with an extensive pericarp, and, rivaling the orb of the moon.Above
that lotus was the lad Suvarṇavarṇa, seated cross-legged upon its pericarp.Seeing
him seated cross-legged upon the pericarp of the lotus, the many hundreds of thousands of
millions of deities that were in the sky let out an exclamation:

"Ah! the greatness of the teaching, that even a disciple thus performs what is the marvel of
the omniscient one, the miracle of the Tathāgata! (1)Rightly performing a great big wonder,
today, the Noble Ānanda has like the Sugata, loftily manifested his greatness. (2)Ah! the
Sun that was the Victorious One having set, here has arisen the glorious sun that is the
Elder Ānanda, the dispeller of the darkness of all distress! (3)The vault of the sky that
is the world has been adorned by the moon that is the Elder Ānanda with rays that are his
wisdom, virtue and greatness. (4)The world, enveloped in darkness on account of being bereft
of the light that was the Sugata, is today well illumined by the light that is the Noble
Ānanda. (5)The jewel of the Buddha, endowed with all imponderable virtues, having disappeared,
the glorious crest-jewel of the world, the Noble Ānanda, has arisen". (6)
