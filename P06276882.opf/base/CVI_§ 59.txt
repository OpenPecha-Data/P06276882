[59] Thereupon, the deities observed the Elder Ānanda’s intention and at that very moment made
that great cemetery free of stones, pebbles and gravel.It was sprinkled about with sandal-water
and perfumed with fragrant incense.It had portals with hoisted flags and banners.On
it were fastened clusters of festoons of cloth.It was bestrewn with very variegated and
fragrant flowers.It was very pleasant like the Nandana park of the gods.In it was prepared
for the Elder Ānanda a great lion-throne which was ornamented with special decorations,
embellished with inlays of various jewels, divine, entirely in gold, and equipped with a foot-stool.Divine
seats were also prepared for those five hundred Arhats.Thereupon, the Elder
Ānanda descended from the sky and sat upon that throne.Those 500 Arhats, too, descended
and sat upon the seats that had been prepared (for them).
