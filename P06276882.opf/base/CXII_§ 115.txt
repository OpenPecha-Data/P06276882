[115] "What do you think, O great king, was he another who during that period of time was the
king, Surūpa by name?Indeed, it should not be considered as such.It is this Suvarṇavarṇa,
who during that period of time was the king, Surūpa by name.Because he presented a piece
of garment, the colour of tumeric, to the Tathāgata, Vipaśyin, and made an earnest wish,
by this ripening of that deed he enjoyed endless divine and human happiness among gods and
men.Wherever he was born, his body was clothed in golden coloured garments, he had a golden
body and at the time of his birth there fell showers of karnikāra flowers.Thus, even now,
so great is he by reason of his merit that though he repeatedly removed the garments from
his body, that very moment another garment appeared upon his body.He who was Karṇa the
caravan leader, is this same caravan leader, Divākara.She who at that period of time was the
wife of the caravan leader Karṇa, is this same wife of the caravan leader, Divākara.Kāśisundarī
was then the female slave, and the chief minister, Pracaṇḍa, was the male slave."
