[114] Then the Perfectly Awakened One, Vipaśyin, departed, after thus predicting unsurpassed,
perfect awakening for that man.This incident spread everywhere in the capital city of Bandhumatī.Finally
it was heard of by the King, Bandhumant.Having heard of it, he came himself,
encouraged in mind by that accumulation of roots of merit, mounted that man upon the shoulder
of an elephant and with very great honour conducted him to his palace. He sat him
upon half of his throne and honoured him with a gift of half his kingdom.He said: "O great
king, I do not seek worldly pleasures, therefore please permit me to go forth and practise
the holy life."Given permission by the king, he went forth in the well-preached Law and
discipline.There, he practised the holy life for as long as he lived and at death was reborn
among the Nirmanarati gods.King Bandhumant, too, having died, his son was set upon the
throne.He, too, died after ruling for some time and the ministers with great respect set Surūpa
upon the throne.He ruled righteously for sixty thousand yearsand at his death was reborn
among the host of Tusita gods.
