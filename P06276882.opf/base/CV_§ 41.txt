[41] Seeing him being removed from the city, many hundreds of thousands of beings began to cry
out aloud in one voice:"Ah! Alas! this caravan leader, Divākara, is deprived of the whole
of his possessions.The Lineage of the parents of the caravan leader Divākara is cut.This
Light of the family of the caravan leader Divākara is extinguished.This joy of the family
of the caravan leader Divākara is made to disappear.This crest-jewel of the family of the
caravan leader Divākara is snatched away.This eye of the caravan leader Divākara is removed.This
ornament of the family of the caravan leader Divākara is snatched away.This heart
of the caravan leader Divākara is rent asunder.These, the Life-breaths personified, of the
caravan leader Divākara are snatched away.Ah! Alas! how, indeed, is the lad, having been
taken about as if in the forest, driven out; and no one has rescued him.Now this moon city
of Rājagṛha is swallowed by Rāhu in the form of Death.This sun (Divākara) in the vault of
the sky of the city of Rājagṛha is setting.This nectar to the eyes of the citizens dwelling
in the city of Rājagṛha is set upon a path beyond the reach of vision.This bond of joy
of the citizens dwelling in the city of Rājagṛha is broken off.This ornament of the citizens
dwelling in the city of Rājagṛha is snatched away.This crest-jewel of the citizens dwelling
in the city of Rājagṛha is snatched away.This beloved of the hearts of the citizens
dwelling in the city of Rājagṛha is taken away for destruction.Whom, now, will the citizens
dwelling in the city of Rājagṛha look upon with unwinking eyes.Now, beholding whom will
they become happy at heart?" They became devoid of hope.
