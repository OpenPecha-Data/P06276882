[122] Now, the caravan leader Divākara, putting the upper robe over one shoulder and placing
his right knee upon the ground, said this with folded palms to the Elder Ānanda:"O noble
Ānanda, I had thought of inviting the community of monks headed by the Awakened One to my
house, feeding them with excellent food and clothing them with robes costing hundreds of thousands.But
as that Fortunate One has entered Nirvāṇa, I now wish to feed the community of
monks headed by the noble Ānanda."The Elder Ānanda said: "O caravan leader, you do so. I
will act in such a way that all the disciples of the Fortunate One resident in Jambudvīpa
will come here."Then the caravan leader Divākara, his mind filled with joy, made a very delightful
place of assembly outside the city of Rājagṛha.It was free from stones, pebbles
and gravel.It had flags and banners raised aloft. It was sprinkled with sandal-water.Fastened
on were bundles of streamers and garlands.It was bestrewn with various flowers.It had
pots of fragrant incense laid out and very beautiful canopies and gateways.That very night
he prepared pure and excellent food and drink.He arose quite early, arranged the seats, set
up water-potsand informed the Elder Ānanda by messenger that it was time saying:"It is
time, Sir, the food is ready if you please."
