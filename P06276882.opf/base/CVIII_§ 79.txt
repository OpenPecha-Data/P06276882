[79] The Elder Ānanda explained: "Great king, these very people formerly, in other births, performed
and accumulated deeds. Who else will experience (in return, the effects of) deeds
performed and piled up by these people themselves. O great king, (the effects of) deeds,
good and bad, performed and accumulated do not mature either in the earth element or in the
water, fire, or wind elements, but in the skandha (agglomerations), dhātu (disposition),
and āyatana (sense-organs and objects) that are acquired. (The effects of) deeds do not vanish
even in a hundred kalpas; having attained fullness and the proper time, they produce
fruit for embodied beings."
