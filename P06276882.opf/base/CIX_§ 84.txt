[84] Thereupon, that handmaid went to the friends, associates and relations of the caravan leader
Karṇa and said:"Sirs, such are the circumstances of the wife of the caravan leader Karṇa.
Give her sustenance."From the very time they began to give her sustenance, hundreds
of misfortunes arose in their families too.They reflected: "This son of the caravan leader
Karṇa is extremely inauspicious.Through the effect of his demerit the entire wealth such
as house and possessions of the caravan leader Karṇa was destroyed.Therefore, should we give
him sustenance, in our houses too, before long, this very same situation would arise as
(in the house of) the caravan leader Karṇa.In every way, it is not proper even to utter his
name." They told the handmaid: "You should not come to our houses again."
