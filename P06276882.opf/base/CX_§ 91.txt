[91] The caravan leader Karṇa, his ship destroyed in the great ocean, somehow found a plank
and, accompanied by a lad, returned coming out of the water onto the land.Wandering about
for alms with great hardship, he came to the capital city of Bandhumatī.There, he took shelter
for the night in a field outside the city.In that place was a certain hired labourer
as caretaker of the field, and he recognized him.It occurred to him: "Here is the caravan
leader, his body quite emaciated and his entire store of wealth destroyed, arrived in the
company of a lad.So, how will I inform him of the news regarding his house? However, he will
come to know of it himself."Having observed thus, he gave him water for washing his hands
and presented him with a couple of bean-cakes.Thereupon, the caravan leader Karṇa, put
one bean-cake aside.Thinking: "Let me not enter the house empty-handed", he entrusted one
to the hands of the boy and dividing the other into quarters, ate it together with that boy
as they had had no food.On another day the caravan leader Karṇa, taking that bean-cake,
entered the capital city of Bandhumatī and proceeded towards his house. His body was extremely
rugged and emaciated. He was possessed merely of a single garment that was very dirty.
