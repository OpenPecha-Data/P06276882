[13] The lad Suvarṇavarṇa constantly attended upon learned men, ascetics and Brāhmaṇas.Whatever
excellent sayings con-formable to the path of liberation he heard, he wrote them down
in a book.The caravan leader Divākara had a park full of flowers, fruits and water, outside
the city of Rājagṛha.The lad Suvarṇavarṇa went daily to that park of his father and remained
there reciting his book of excellent sayings.Now, at that time, there lived in the city
of Rājagṛha a courtesan by the name of Kāśisundarī. Full of beauty and youth, she was dear
to the populace.King Ajātaśatru, too, had a minister, Pracaṇḍa by name, whom he highly
esteemed.His mind exceedingly enamoured of the maiden Kāśisundarī, he (the minister) went
with her daily to his own park and enjoyed amorous sport.
