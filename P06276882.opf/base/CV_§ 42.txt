[42] One of the servants of the minister Pracaṇḍa came and informedthat the lad Suvarṇavarṇa
had been driven out from the city of Rājagṛha.Hearing it, he became glad at heart.Then those
citizens, the men of business, having heard it, became devoid of hope.They returned and
related that episode in detail to those citizens.On hearing it, those citizens, too, became
devoid of hope.Distressed, they said to one another:"Sirs, this quarrelsome king deprived
his father, who was such a pious and righteous king, of his life.Now, he has begun to
execute even such distinguished men of renowned virtues, dear to the populace, and rarely
to be seen.Ah! the mercilessness! Ah! the lack of appreciation of virtues!Ah! the lack of
discrimination of the ministers! How is such a virtuous and distinguished man who is, indeed,
thus worthy of respect on account of the exceeding nobility of his figure, and on account
of being well-behaved, given up for execution without investigation?Perhaps such a time
has come as that when the bad prosper,and there will be such a separation of one endowed
with such virtues."Manifesting the decline of the times, they related this episode in detail
to the caravan leader, Divākara.
