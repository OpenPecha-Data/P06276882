[110] Now, on another day, that hired servant, caretaker of a field, took a bowl of food duly
given him by his master and set out to the field early in the morning.On his way he heard
from a certain lay devotee that the caravan leader Karṇa, having presented the Fortunate,
the Awakened One with a single bean-cake, had obtained much glory.On hearing this he asked
that lay devotee: "O good man, what are the merits of that Fortunate One?"He replied: "Gentle
sir, what power do I have to describe the specially endowed virtues of the Fortunate
One! Please listen to this much in brief.That Fortunate One, the Fully Awakened One, is
indeed adorned with the characteristic marks of a superior person.He has the lustre of the
golden mountain (i.e. Meru).He has an excessive radiance equal to that of the sun and the
moon.He is heroic, religious, tranquil in mind, eloquent, well dressed, fair-limbed, fair-faced,
fair-eyed, diligent, just, patient and confident.He is a trainer and a good guide.He
is a knower of good conduct and restraint, grateful, and sharp-eyed.He is composed in his
sense-faculties.The horses that are his sense-faculties are well tamed.He is the great
king of the law, the very best of creatures, the great protector of the world, the great banner
of knowledge, the great hero of disputants, the great treasury of merit, the great source
of the law, the great caravan leader, the great law-giver, the great helmsman, greatly
worthy of gifts, the remover of desire, the great destroyer of delusion.He extinguishes
anger, establishes people in liberation, makes them depart from evil ways, points out the
true path, removes doubt, teaches the truths, stills the depravities, annihilates Evil, and
rescues the world.He is honoured by Brahman and revered by Śakra.He is superior to all
the world, brings profit to all the world, is supreme of all beings, brings to an end all
suffering and is all-knowing.He is expert in conduct and discipline and has transcended all
evil influences.He is not overcome by the best of debators and not led astray by all faults.He

worthy of gifts.Seeing the world greatly suffering and sunk in the mire of ignorance,
he is himself able to rescue it.With his supreme thoughts directed towards compassion for
all beings in accordance with his own power, he gave rise firmly to thoughts such as"How shall
I rescue them? How shall I free the sorrowing world? How shall I comfort the frightened?
How shall I rescue the world sunk in the stream of transmigration? and How shall I refresh
the world that is being consumed?"With courage, throughout hundreds of thousands of crores
of former births, he gave away food, drink, shelter, footwear, victuals, parasols, chariots
and seats, etc., as well as his delightful elephants, horses, wife and children and
male and female servants.He also cut off his own head, eyes and flesh and gave as for instance
to Indra in the guise of a falcon intending the welfare of all beings by all means.And
at all times, beholding the aged, the sick, and the dying, the deluded, the perplexed
and the perturbed he comforted them all himself, whether they were present before him or not.He
has attained the peaceful and highest wisdom after many hundreds of thousands of crores
of births by practising charity, virtue, patience, courage, wisdom and meditation.Who
is able to describe the complete virtues of that Perfectly Awakened One.He is the foremost
of all beings, perfectly awakened, and renowned for his fame.His teaching is trustworthy
and known for its compassion.He is full of discernment and has extensive energy.He has successfully
accomplished all promises.He is free from faults.He has cast out delusion.He is
