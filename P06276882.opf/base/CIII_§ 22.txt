[22] The king’s officers, too, arrived there and having entered it began to search that park.Now
they saw the maiden Kāśisundarī dragged hither and thither, her hair dishevelled, and
fallen senseless upon the ground.On account of the power of the fruition of the former deeds
of the lad Suvarṇavarṇa nobody ascertained whether she was just unconscious or whether
she was dead at that time.Then the king’s officers said to one another:"Sirs, this woman
has been slain by someone".They searched that whole park and did not see anyone other than
the lad Suvarṇavarṇa.They questioned the lad Suvarṇavarṇa:"Lad, who killed this woman?"He
replied: "Sirs, I, too, do not know, I, too, saw her just so."
