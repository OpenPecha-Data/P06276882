[15] She reflected: "Surely, he is shy; so he does not pay heed to me here. He is proceeding
to the park. I, too, will go there.There I will secretly entice him."She followed behind
him and was perceived by the lad Suvarṇavarṇa.He entered ahead and fastened the door of that
park.The maiden Kāśisundarī said:"Lad, how is it proper thus? I have come for your sake.
It is not proper for you to show such severity towards me."He did not give her a reply at
all.She reflected: "There are two probable reasons:either he has absolutely no use of pleasures
or he is seized by a great affliction.It is not at all possible for me to gratify
him with my figure or with speech; I will gratify him through the sense of touch.He, however,
fastens the door on seeing me.What means is there whereby I could meet with him secretly?Perhaps,
unknown to him I will come beforehand tomorrow, enter the park and remain there.When
he arrives later, I will so gratify him with the touching of his limbs in the form
of embraces, etc., that he will become dependent on me."Thinking thus, she turned back and
entered the city.That day she did not go to the park of the minister Pracaṇḍa.
