[63] Then, the lad, Suvarṇavarṇa, having listened to the Elder Ānanda, began to make a truthful
resolve, his mind devoted to the aspirations of all beings:"By that truth and asseveration
of truth of mine, that there arose not in me, towards the maiden Kāśisundarī, even the
minutest impurity, be it either passion, or enmity, or delusion, or injury, or any one of
the secondary mental impurities, bythis truth and asseveration of truth, may the poison
disappear from her body."Then, immediately after this truthful resolve was made, the poison
disappeared from the body of the maiden Kāśisundarī.Herself restored to life, she arose
as if awakened from sleep.Having seen her arisen, herself restored to life, that great mass
of people and the many hundreds of thousands of deities uttered loudly in unison:"Ah, the
wonder! Ah, the purity of the mental disposition of the lad!Of great power is this lad and
of great might, insofar as, now, by the force of truthful resolve, this maiden Kāśisundarī
has been made to arise and is clothed with her dear life."Then, the maiden Kāśisundarī
began to look around.There, in the great cemetery, she saw the Elder Ānanda, together with
a great host of monks, and hidden (by them) in the form of a half moon, seated upon a large
and divine lion-throne radiant with various jewels king Ajātaśatru, accompanied by many
hundreds of thousands of beings as well as herself placed upon a litter [decorated with]
blue, yellow, red and white (cloth).Having thus seen, she was bewildered and began to think:"Is
this a dream, or is it mental derangement,or is it that someone would have displayed
this magic act?"Then, her relatives, described this in detailand added: "In every way this,
your life, is entirely owing to the Elder Ānanda."
