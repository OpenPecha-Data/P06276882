[20] Then, the maiden Kāśisundarī, considering herself as if revived from the dead, arose quickly
and went up to the wall (of the park) with the intention of running away.But the wall
was high and she was not able to jump over it.The minister, Pracaṇḍa, returned and, not
seeing the maiden Kāśisundarī at that place, began to look here and there.When he saw her
gone near the wall, he very quickly began to go near her.There was a black serpent there,
and she was bitten on her right foot by it.Having seen him (i.e. the minister), it ran away.The
maiden Kāśisundarī reflected:"This minister, Pracaṇḍa, upon arriving, will kill me."Her
thoughts directed towards him, trembling out of fear of death, and not aware that she
was bitten by a black serpent, (she entered a thicket of Atimuktaka creepers).The minister,
Pracaṇḍa, arrived at that thicket of Atimuktaka creepers.Then, evil-natured, pitiless at
heart, and his mind confused with fierce anger, he dragged the maiden Kāśisundarī from that
thicket of Akimuktaka creepers and gave a kick on her head with his heel.Being very delicate,
she fainted on account of that blow as well as the effect of the (serpent’s) poison.The
minister, Pracaṇḍa, began to observe her. When he saw her fallen senseless upon the ground,
it occurred to him : "She is dead, I will now go away."Then, lest someone should see
him, he jumped over the wall and entered Rājagṛha by a different route.Having done so, he
ordered the king’s officers saying:"Go, examine the park of the caravan leader Divākara."
They departed.
