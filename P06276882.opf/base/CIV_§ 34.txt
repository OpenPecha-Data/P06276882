[34] The caravan leader, Divākara, too, after a successful sea voyage, arrived at Rājagṛha.Entering
the city of Rājagṛha he observed impropitious omens.His heart began to tremble. His
limbs began to go limp.His eye throbbed. Birds, too, began to shriek harshly in front of
him.Being adept in omens and versed in the notes of birds, he started to think:"Inasmuch
as I observe these impropitious omens, today, a great calamity must be at hand for the lad
Suvarṇavarṇa.For indeed these omens indicate separation from him." He said:

"Inasmuch as my eye throbs and the bird shrieks, separation from my son is certainly at hand
today. (1)Inasmuch as my Limbs go Limp and my heart trembles, terrible separation from my
son is certainly at hand, today." (2)
