[117] At a later time, a monk named Ajita, a preacher of the law possessing a ready presence
of mind, and versed in diverse and charming stories,while journeying over the countryside,
came to that monastery.He, too, preached the law to the fourfold assemblies.He expounded
the holy life that was excellent in the beginning, excellent in the middle, excellent at
the end, of good purport, well expressed, complete, perfect, clean and pure.He won the faith
of the entire multitude of people dwelling in that village.He became the recipient of equipment
consisting of robes, bowl, couch and medicines to cure the sick.The profit and respect
of that resident monk, the preacher of the law, was lost. It occurred to him thus:"The
loss of my profit and respect has been brought about by the monk Ajita.So, how could there
be profit and respect for me as long as he remains here?I must think of a plan that would
cause his departure."Again, he reflected: "The learned are indeed fearful of the loss
of respect.I should employ (a strategy that would bring about) a want of respect towards him."
Having conceived thus, he told a certain Brahmin girl:"Sister, I will give you a pair
of garments, slander this monk Ajita, saying "He practised unchastity together with me".She
replied: "Noble one, if I were to say so, who would then marry me?I will surely have to
be looked after by my mother and father for as long as I live."He said: "I will act in such
a way that it will not become known to many people.On the other hand, you may talk freely
when I am seated here together with three or four other monks."She agreed to do accordingly.
