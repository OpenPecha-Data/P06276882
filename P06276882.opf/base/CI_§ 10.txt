[10] Later, on another occasion, the lad Suvarṇavarṇa had gone to the Bamboo Grove and there
was a monk reciting stanzas concerning impermanence: -

Day and night, the life of a man, whether he moves or is still, like the current of great rivers,
goes on and halts not. (1)As for fish in scanty water, what pleasure, indeed, would
there be for them whose life becomes shorter with the passing of each night. (2)This body,
withered, a nest of disease, fragile and a mass of purulent matter, will crumble; indeed,
life terminates with death. (3)Before long, indeed, this body will lie upon the earth, empty
and devoid of consciousness, like a discarded faggot. (4)What is the use of this body,
for ever discharging purulent matter, constantly overwhelmed by disease and dreadful with
decay and death. (5)By means of this mass of purulent matter, fragile and diseased one should
attain the supreme peace, the unsurpassed salvation. (6)
