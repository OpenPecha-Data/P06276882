[82] The male and female slaves, workmen and servants of the caravan leader Karṇa, seeing that
disaster and thinking ‘let us go, lest we too should perish’, became frightened and fled,
abandoning the wife of the caravan leader Karṇa.Then, a certain handmaid reflected:"I have
enjoyed manifold blessings in the house of the caravan leader Karṇa.It is not becoming
that in this situation I should flee abandoning his wife who is helpless and alone."Only
she remained by the side of the caravan leader’s wife.All that wealth of that caravan leader’s
wife was consumed by the fire and she did not have even a day’s meal left.
