[17] The maiden Kāśisundarī, too, her body decked with various garments and ornaments, departing
from the city of Rājagṛha went to the park of the caravan leader Divākara.When she entered
there, she saw the minister Pracaṇḍa and, terrified on seeing him,reflected: "As he
is fierce by very nature, he will surely do me great harm today." She desired to turn back.Thereupon,
the minister Pracaṇḍa saw her and his mind ablaze with the fire of anger, contracted
his brows in triple folds upon his forehead and ran towards her.Then, quickly seizing
her by her hair, he unmercifully hurled her upon the ground face downwards,dragged her,
and said thus: "You come here and amuse yourself with the lad Suvarṇavarṇa,but to me you
say: ’I did not come to you as a headache pains me much today’.Therefore, I will employ such
a restraint upon you today that your Ladyship will never again see the world of the Living
or amuse yourself with the lad Suvarṇavarṇa."On hearing this, the maiden Kāśisundarī,
discounting the pain arising from his dragging her to and fro, terrified by the fear of death,
with her voice faltering on account of being choked with tears, thinking "Alas, now I
will cease to exist",and trembling in her limbs fell down at the feet of the minister Pracaṇḍa
and spoke to him in pathetic, sad and hesitant words:"Let my master be pleased. It does
not behove you to kill me. Womankind is ever full of faults.Hence-forth, I will act thus
no more,I will be your slave to the end of my life.Enough, therefore, of this rashness;
grant me my life."Though being spoken to thus in pathetic, sad and hesitant words, the fire
of anger of that wicked man did, indeed, increase.He said to the man that accompanied him:"Quickly
cut off her head completely with this sword and cast it upon the ground."
