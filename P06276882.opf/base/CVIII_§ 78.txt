[78] Thereupon, the king asked the Elder Ānanda: - "Elder, what deed was performed by the caravan
leader Divākara, together with his wife,as the fruit whereof he became rich and possessed
of great wealth and great comforts;and also achieved realization of the truth in the
teaching of the Fortunate One?What deeds were performed by the monks Kāśisundara and Pracaṇḍa,
whereby, having gained birth in families that were rich, possessed of great wealth and
great comforts, they obtained ordainment in the teaching of the Fortunate One and realized
Arhatship by getting rid of all defilements?What deed was performed by the monk, Suvarṇavarṇa,
too, as the fruit whereof he was born in a family that was rich,possessed of great
wealth and great comforts, and is so handsome, charming and pleasant, endowed with all major
and minor limbs, and provided with an excellent complexion the colour of purified gold,
captivates the eyes and minds of everyone, and has a body clothed in golden-yellow garments?From
his body wafts the fragrance of sandal and from his mouth that of blue lotuses.At
his birth there fell showers of garments and Karṇikāra flowers; these garments were golden
in colour.Thus possessed of great power and of great might to an excessive degree, he has
obtained ordainment in the teaching of the Fortunate One and has realized Arhatship by
getting rid of all defilements."
