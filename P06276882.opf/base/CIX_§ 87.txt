[87] Seeing her crying and tormented by sorrow thus, the handmaid began to cry:"Ah, alas! In
this very life the wife of the caravan leader wore variegated clothes such as of fine cloth
from Kāśi, her body was adorned with various garlands of fragrant flowers,and her cheeks
were perfumed with face-perfumes prepared out of fragrant substances. She was like a divine
damsel in the Nandana parkand she presented her male and female slaves, workmen, servants,
friends, associates and relations with food, drink, clothes and ornaments, as was appropriate
to each.But, now, in this very life, her hair is dishevelled, her body is smeared
with layers of dirt, and all the limbs of her body are shriveled by pains such as of hunger.She
wears a worn out strip of cloth and the region of her hips is covered with a very dirty
and ragged garment that had become the home of hundreds of lice.Become the lowest in
the entire city, she performs work for wages in the houses of others and suffers great pain
and dejection.Ah! the reversal of fortune! Ah! fickle is the abundance of enjoyment! Ah!
the variety of the effect of actions!" She also said :

"She, who formerly went to this street-entrance like a divine damsel, wearing garments of fine
cloth, etc., and adorned with all ornaments, (1)that very woman through the reversal of
fortune now goes to it thus, wearing a worn out and ragged garment, her limbs smeared with
dirt. (2)Formerly, like a divine maiden, she was nectar to the eyes of men. Now seeing her
like a female ghost, the mind shudders. (3)Formerly, with an abundance of wealth, she was
the foremost in the city. Today, that very woman has reached the extreme lowliness of even
the wretched. (4)She who formerly did enjoy great abundance with delight, today, arrived
at this condition, grieves in pain. (5)Ah! the wickedness of transmigration. Ah! the fickleness
of abundance, that she having thus been in comfort is now the receptacle for sorrow
." (6)
