[12] Thereupon, the lad Suvarṇavarṇa, his mind disturbed by the fear of transmigration, went
home and, falling at his mother’s feet, said: "Mother, give me permission; I wish to be ordained
in the well preached doctrine and discipline."Hearing this, his mother became greatly
dejected and, beating her breast, said:"Son, you are my only child, beloved, charming,
handsome, not obstinate and obtained with hundreds of wishes.How, indeed, will you leave
me and become ordained?"He replied: "Mother, there must necessarily be separation from beloved
ones; therefore, give me permission, I will become ordained in the well preached doctrine
and discipline."Upon hearing this, great anxiety arose in her and, her voice choked with
tears, she said:"Son, do not ask me thrice, lest hot blood comes forth from my mouth."She
deliberated: "His determination is such that it will not be possible for me to stop him.
I will contrive an expedient."She then said: "Son, your father set out to sea with the
thought of doing homage to the teaching of the Awakened One.I will not give you permission
until such time as he returns.If, upon his return, he gives you permission, you may become
ordained."He, being devoted to his mother, deliberated: "Should I ask her again, she will
perhaps enter into great anxiety.I will, therefore, wait as long as my father does not arrive."
He remained silent.Whenever the lad Suvarṇavarṇa made his appearance in the street,
seeing the excellence of the nobility of his figure, the people looking at him found no
satisfaction.He became dear to the great mass of people. Seeing his extreme aversion to pleasures,
though himself attractive on account of the excellence of the nobility of his figure,
his mother reflected:"Ah! Alas! his determination is such that he will leave me and become
ordained."Thereafter, constantly apprehensive, she began to behave agreeably towards
him.
