[43] Having heard that, his hopes shattered, the caravan leader, DivƒÅkara, smitten by the pain
of intense sorrow, fainted and fell upon the ground.Then, having regained his senses with
the sprinkling of water, dejected in mind, devoid of joy, and saying: "Presently, my son
will be executed",he began to cry out aloud:

"Delight of the eyes, alas! my son. Alas! the ornament of my family! Dear child, of me that
am unfortunate, having no protector, you will be executed. (1)My heart grows faint and, now,
the quarters reel, as it were. Inflamed by the fire of separation from you, my mind is.
Indeed, consumed. (2)Alas! dear child, how has terrible disaster befallen you, that art learned,
disciplined, and delighting in compassion. (3)Son, having obtained unequalled joy
produced at your birth, I am, good son, fallen again into the fire of sorrow on account of
separation from you. (4)Alas! the ministers of this king, by whom you- son, possessed of
discipline, have not thus been investigated, are devoid of mercy and ignorant of excellences.
(5)Alas! this lack of mercy has been manifested by that king by whom- you, dear son, have
thus without investigation been abandoned today. (6)Shame, that, an excellent good man
has vanished from (their) hearts, that you, son, are being executed, having no protector,
though possessed of virtues. (7)Is it that all the deities of this city are gone away, that
they overlook such a virtuous man that is being executed? (8)May Indra and the Guardians
of the World, and whatever gods that are possessed of great power, show compassion and protect
my dear son. (9)What sages now exist, that are magnanimous and have fulfilled their
vows, may they show compassion and rescue my son." (10)
