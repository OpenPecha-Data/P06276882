[121] "What do you think, O great king, was he another who at that period of time was the monk,
the preacher of the Law?You should not think so; but, indeed, he was this monk Suvarṇavarṇa
who at that time having become angered committed this act of harsh speech.As the fruit
of that action he was reborn in hells during five hundred former births and being reborn
among men during five hundred births was placed upon a stake though guiltless and innocent.Even
in this life, on account of that same act, he was placed upon the stake though guiltless
and innocent.Having committed that act, had he not acknowledged his transgression,
he would be reborn in each one of the great hells during five hundred rebirths.He would also
be reborn among departed spirits and among animals during five hundred rebirths.Because
he practised the holy life in the teaching of the Fortunate One, Candra, he has now obtained
ordainment in the teaching of the Fortunate One and has attained Arhatship by getting
rid of all the depravities.Therefore, O great king, if you do not desire suffering for yourself,
you should not foul your mind against others.Frightened of disrepute you should not
yourself malign others.Desiring your own happiness, you should provide for the happiness
of others too."With the utterance of this religious discourse many hundreds of thousands of
beings attained great distinction.Some attained the fruit of entrance into the stream, some
the fruit of once-returning, some the fruit of non-returning, some obtained ordainment
and attained Arhatship by getting rid of all the depravities.Some begot thoughts of supreme
enlightenment, others the enlightenment of the disciples.Some took the refuges and the
commandments.For the most part, that assembly was made inclined towards the Awakened One,
bent upon the law and partial towards the community of monks.
