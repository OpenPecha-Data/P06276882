[85] Reviled by them, she thought:"Now, the wife of the caravan leader is entirely devoid of
help.How should I proceed in this matter?But, since I have taken on this responsibility,
I must now look after the caravan leader’s wife even better."Thereupon, she went to the houses
of others and began to work for wagesand with whatever money she obtained thereby, began
to maintain the caravan leader’s wife, herself, and the boy.Because of his extreme ugliness,

that decreased every day.Thenceforth, the three of them began to maintain themselves with
intense hardship.
