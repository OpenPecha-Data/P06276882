[19] Thereupon, that wicked one, on account of his adverse disposition, though being thus addressed
by that man with words that captivated the heart, did not regain his senses.With his
face fierce on account of the contraction of his eyebrows through anger, he said to that
man:"Man! What regard do you have for her that, violating my order, you do not wish to kill
her?"In every way, if you kill her it will be good; should you on the contrary not kill
her, your life, too, will now cease to be."Then, that man having become aware of that harsh
intention of his became frightened and began to reflect:"Alas, I am in extreme danger.If
I do not carry out his order, he will certainly deprive me of my life today.Whence could
it be that he who is, indeed, prepared to kill such a woman as this who was enjoyed in many
ways, will not kill me.How, indeed, can I consider myself as a man and yet cast a weapon
upon the body of such a woman, a beauty of the country."He decided : "In every way, I would
rather lose my life than give her a blow", and the thought occurred to him:"Should I
run away with my sword, I would thus protect myself, and the maiden Kāśidundarī, too."Then,
taking his sword and coming out of that park he ran away at full speed.The minister, Pracaṇḍa,
chased after him as far as the gate.
