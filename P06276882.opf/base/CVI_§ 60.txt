[60] King Ajātaśatru, too, arrived there surrounded by many hundreds of thousands of beings.He
saw that manifestation of might and the lad, Suvarṇavarṇa, seated upon the pericarp, above
the lotus that rivaled the orb of the moon, like the full-moon in the autumn season set
free from masses of clouds, and shining with glory like a sacrificial post of gold.Having
observed (these), his mind overcome by extreme amazement, the hairs on his body bristling,
his lotus face being filled with wave upon wave of extreme joy, and his mind overcome by
the onset of extreme faith,he fell prostrate at the feet of the Elder Ānanda.Then, having
lightly touched his feet with the pout of his mouth, he arose and placing his knees upon
the ground, looking up with folded palms at the Elder Ānanda, said:

"Homage to you, Supreme teacher, by whom thus performing the rescue of this person, I myself
have been helped out. (1)Had both I and this man not been heeded by you, O Sage, I would
have been destroyed by the thunderbolt of words of censure. (2)Had you not been my protector,
the sage beneficial to all beings, I would, this very day, have been consumed by the forest-fire
of repentance. (3)Ah! the greatness of your wisdom and this excellent compassion.
Ah! this wonderful act, too, that has properly been manifested. (4)Having observed this
most wonderful miracle of yours, O sinless one, methinks that the Tathāgata, indeed, has
not gone to his final rest. (5)You are the protector of people that are fallen into distress;
you are their last resort. Beneficial to all beings, you are beloved, just like the Tathāgata.
(6)What joy I had, formerly, looking at the Fortunate One, that same (is mine) today,
looking at you who looks after the teaching of the Victorious One." (7)
