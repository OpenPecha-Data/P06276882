[23] Then, the king’s officers began to speak to one another:"Sirs, this lad is extremely well-behaved.
This action cannot be thought possible of him.But we do not see anyone else here.
In every way, we are in extreme difficulty. How should we proceed in this matter?"Then,
one of them said: "Sirs, as we are unable to decide,let us take this woman and the lad to
the hall of justice so that the ministers themselves may decide."Then, the king’s officers
raised that woman on to a litter and went with the lad Suvarṇavarṇa to the hall of justice.There,
at the hall of justice, the minister, Pracaṇḍa, was seated together with magistrates
who by their very conduct were well-disposed,assembled for the most part in expectation
of the arrival of the king’s officers themselves.Having seen them while yet at a distance
he asked: "Sirs, what is this?"They said: "We saw this woman dead in the park of the caravan
leader Divākara.We examined the park but saw no one other than the lad Suvarṇavarṇa.We
asked him: ’Who killed this woman" and he replied: ’Sirs, I, too, do not know. Even I
found her thus.’Now, therefore, may your lordships yourselves investigate."
