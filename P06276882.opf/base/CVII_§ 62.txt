[62] Then, the lad, Suvarṇavarṇa, began to reflect:"If I tell this king that this act was caused
to be done to me by the minister, Pracaṇḍa,as this king is impetuous, there is the chance
that he would immediately execute the minister, Pracaṇḍa.Therefore, how should I proceed
in this matter?Or rather, the responsibility for the consequences of one’s own actions
should he had recourse to.Surely, in former births, I have committed a sinful and unwholesome
act of which this is the consequence;except on account of the consequence of former actions,
a faultless one would not thus be abandoned for execution."Having arrived at this
decision he told the king:

"That sinful act was committed by me alone in former births, O King, of which a consequence
such as this is at hand. (1)Therefore, experiencing now the consequence, undesired as it is,
of one’s own acts, whom, indeed, shall I point out?" (2)

Having said thus, he went near the Elder Ānanda, and fell down prostrate at his feet.The Elder
Ānanda said:"Dear child, this maiden, Kāśisundarī, has been seized by the effect of poison.So,
arise and make her well by means of a truthful resolve, and win the confidence of
the great mass of people."
