[4] Then Śakra, the lord of the gods, disappeared from among the gods of the world of the Thirty-three
Gods and stood upon the uppermost floor of the house of the merchant Divākara in
the city of Rājagṛha.On account of the splendour of the complexion of Śakra, the lord of
the gods, that entire house became radiant with a divine radiance.The caravan leader, Divākara,
saw that divine radiance.Having seen it, his eyes wide open with wonder, he began to
look all around, till he beheld Śakra, the lord of the gods.On seeing him, he quickly fell
at his feet and said:"O lord of the gods, profit is mine whose house you have visited,
and it, too, has been sanctified by your coming;therefore, please declare the purpose of your
visit."Śakra, the lord of the gods, replied: "O caravan leader, you are childless, and
desirous of children. Therefore, together with your wife, take refuge from today onwards
in the Three Jewels for the length of your life, and you will have a son."The caravan leader,
Divākara, thrilled, pleased and elated at heart, said:"O lord of the gods, I will do as
you command.Here I, together with my wife, take refuge from today onwards in the Three Jewels
for the length of my life".Now, Śakra, the lord of the gods, established the caravan
leader, Divākara, together with his wife, in the seeking of refuge in the Three Jewels and,
disappearing from Rājagṛha, stood in the abode of that deity in the World of the Thirty-three
Gods.Then, Śakra, the lord of the gods, narrated that episode in detail to that deity.
