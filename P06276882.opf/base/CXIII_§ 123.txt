[123] Now, the Elder Ānanda rose into the sky and by magic power illumined this entire Jambudvīpa
with a radiance that had the lustre of molten gold.He himself beat the gong and proclaimed
with a lofty voice that was as deep as the rumblings of clouds laden with water:"May
those disciples of the Fortunate One that have obtained magic power come hither by their
own magic power, and may the ordinary men come by my magic power."Then, on hearing that gong,
those monks that had obtained the happiness of the attainments of meditation and that
dwelt in river-valleys, solitary abodes, cemeteries, etc. in dwellings, in forests, streams,
rocky-springs, oceans, towns and lofty trees, in mountains such as Himavat, Vindhya, Malaya,
Pāriyātraka, Gandhamādana, Sumeru, Yugandhara, Īṣādhāra, Khadiraka, Sudarśana, Aśvakarṇa
and Nimindhara, came at that very moment covering the sky as it were with masses of
clouds reddened by the twilight and resembling Aśoka and Kiṃśuka flowers in colour, to the
city of Rājagṛha and descended upon that place of assembly.At that very moment there were
assembled three crores of monks:one of Arhats free from the depravitiesthe second of disciples
undergoing trainingand the third of good ordinary men.Thereupon, they sat upon the seats
that bad been prepared each according to the order of his seniority.
