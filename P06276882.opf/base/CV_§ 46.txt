[46] Thus, having lamented in many ways, he asked that lay-devotee:"Sir, does there still remain
some great disciple of that Fortunate One,having handed the teaching to whom, the Fortunate
One has entered Nirvāṇa?"Thereupon, that lay-devotee said: "Caravan leader, it is heard
that the Fortunate One entered Nirvāṇa after handing over the teaching to the Elder Mahākāśyapa,and
that the Elder Mahākāśyapa entered Nirvāṇa after handing over the teaching
to the Elder Ānanda in accordance with the instructions of the Fortunate One.At present, the
magnanimous Elder Ānanda takes care of the teaching.Now, like the Tathāgata, out of compassion,
he goes to various villages, cities, market-places, hamlets and towns and gives assistance
to people fit for conversion.Thus, he performs the planting of roots of merit for
beings that have not planted roots of merit.He performs the bringing to maturity thereof
for beings that have accumulated roots of merit.He rescues beings whose roots of merit have
matured.Likewise, with the giving of the medicine of the preaching of the law, he treats
beings seized by the sickness of the depravities, like a good physician.With the mass of
rays of the light of the preaching of the true law, he dispels the darkness of the depravities
of the beings enveloped by the darkness of the depravities, like the sun.With the multitude
of the rays of his speech, he awakens the forest of the white lotuses of people fit
for conversion, like the moon.With the preaching of the true law he instructs the thousands
of vassal princes that are people fit for conversion, like a universal emperor.With the
roar of confidence in his own wisdom he puts to flight the herds of the deer of the adherents
of false creeds, like a lion.He leads across the merchants that are the people fit for
conversion by instruction, like a guide.He brings about the acquisition of the wares of
the true law, like a caravan leader.He causes the germinating of the seeds of merit, like
a great cloud.He gives advice as to what is beneficial and what is disadvantageous, like
mother and father.He tames untamed beings, liberates the unliberated, consoles the unconsoled,
and makes those that have not entered Nirvāṇa enter it.Similarly, he frees from great
perils beings that have met with hardship, danger, and distress.In brief, that magnanimous
one performs the work of the Awakened One.Call him, indeed, to mind.He is capable of rescuing
your son now from this danger."
