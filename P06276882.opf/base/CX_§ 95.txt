[95] "Who is declining? Who is improving?Who has met with hardship? Who has met with danger?
Who has met with distress? Who has met with hardship, danger and distress?Who is headed for
hell? Who is prone to hell? Who is inclined towards hell?Today, who is to be raised up
by me from the great ocean of transmigration? Who, that is being injured by the great demon
of the impurities, is to be liberated by me today? Who that is being attacked by the serpents
of poverty is to be protected by me today?Who, with his body inflamed by the fire of
hatred, is to be sprinkled by me today with a shower of the Good Law?Who, with his mental
dispositions entered into the great darkness of delusion, is to he placed by me, today, upon
the excellent peak of concentration which is unsurpassed and possessed of an illumination
which is not at all gloomy?To whom should I, today, teach the eight-fold medicine of the
good path, which brings about the destruction of all sorrow?To whom should I today declare
the complete breaking open of the door-panel of poverty?Who that has eyes obstructed by
the darkness of ignorance should today be given the ointment of knowledge by me? Who is
to be liberated, today, from the bond of the mighty shackles?" He also said:

"The ocean, the abode of sea-monsters, may indeed overshoot the coast-line; but the Awakened
One will not disregard an opportunity on hehalf of the children susceptible to instruction."
