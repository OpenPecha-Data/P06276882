[29] He was very dear to women. Smitten by the sorrow of separation from him, some women there
turned over and over upon the ground;some beat their breasts; and others fell into a stupor.There,
one by one, they experienced the grief similar to that at separation from an only
child.As that magnanimous one was dear to the populace, the mass of people inhabiting
the city of Rājagṛha, altogether smitten by the sorrow of separation from him, began to lament.The
city of Rājagṛha appeared to be in utter confusion and trembled smitten by the sorrow
of separation from him.
