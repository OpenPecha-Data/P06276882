[32] Smitten with grief, the pain of which became the more intense the more she did not behold
the lad Suvarṇavarṇa, and lamenting aloud, the wife of the caravan leader, fell at the
feet of each person and, with folded palms, requested:"Help me, help me. Quick, give me the
opportunity that the lad is not taken past by this road.The lad, Suvarṇavarṇa, my son, is
being taken along this road. Please do me the favour of allowing me to see him."Not getting
an opportunity there, she threw herself prostrate upon the ground, saying: "Alas, why,
sirs, do I not get my son?"Then like a female fish taken out of the water, she began to turn
over and over upon the ground.Like a female osprey robbed of its young, she lamented quite
pitifully.She cried out with manifold cries of Lamentation Like a cow [with its manifold
bellowing] that had Lost its calf."Alas! my son. Alas! dear and charming one! Alas! Loved
one! Alas! agreeable one!Alas! one obtained with a hundred wishes! Alas handsome one!
charming one! pleasant one! Alas! one endowed with all major and minor Limbs!Alas! one possessed
of an excellence of complexion, the colour of purified gold!Alas! captivator of the
eyes and minds of all people! Alas! one dear to all people! Alas! giver of delight to the
eyes!Alas! learned one! well-behaved one! proficient one! one that speaks what is agreeable
to the mind! Alas! compassionate one! lover of righteousness! dear to living beings! Alas!
the illuminator of my family!Alas! the light of my family! Alas! the darling of my heart!
Alas! the entirety of my heart! Alas! the aggregate of my essence! Alas! the ambrosia
of my eyes!Alas! the bond of my joy! Alas! the entirety of my family!Alas! without investigation
and helpless, how is he thus taken away for execution!"
