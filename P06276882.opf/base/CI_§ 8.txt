[8] The birth festival was held extensively for three weeks comprising twenty-one days for the
boy when he was born. Deciding upon a name saying"What may be the name of the boy?"the
relatives said: "This boy is possessed of an excellence of complexion, the colour of purified
gold.Therefore, let the name of the boy be Suvarṇavarṇa". He was given the name Suvarṇavarṇa.The
boy, Suvarṇavarṇa, was entrusted to eight nurses:two to carry the baby upon their
hips; two wet-nurses; two to cleanse him, and two to amuse him. He soon grew up like a
lotus in a pool.When he became older he was educated in writing, arithmetic, accounting, calculation,
debits, deposits and trusts. He became an expounder, explainer, scholar, one of
skilful performance in the eight examinations, the examination of sites, garments, elephants,
horses, wood 3, jewels, boys and girls.He was a believer, gracious, possessed of good
intensions, active for the welfare of himself and of others,compassionate, magnanimous,
loving righteousness and dear to beings. He studied all the treatises.Being exceedingly distinguished
by reason of his merit, whatever wealth, such as clothes, etc., he thought of
or wished for, all that accrued to him accordingly;but he was not aware that he was thus distinguished
by reason of his merit.The caravan leader, Divākara, thinking that a son was
born to him through the power of taking refuge in the Three Jewels, became still more favourably
disposed towards the teaching of the Fortunate One.From time to time he did homage
to the teaching of the Fortunate One.
