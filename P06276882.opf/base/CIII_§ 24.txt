[24] The minister, Pracaṇḍa, said: "Sirs, wait a moment, till I inform the king."He went to
the palace of the king Ajātaśatru and asked the door-keeper: "What is his majesty doing?"He
said: "He is on the terrace at the top of the palace playing and amusing himself with musical
entertainment provided by women alone."As he was one who had gained (the king’s) confidence,
he despatched a female door-keeper saying: "Go, inform his majesty of this request
of his ministers:’The maiden Kāśisundarī has been slain in the park by the son of the caravan
leader Divākara.He, however, does not admit (of the crime). How should we proceed in
this matter?’"She went and informed the king. The king, being too occupied in amorous sport,
said:"Go, say thus to the ministers: ’May you yourselves carefully investigate.’"She came
out and informed the minister, Pracaṇḍa, saying: "His majesty authorizes thus."
