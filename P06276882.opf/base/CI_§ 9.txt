[9] Now, at that time, in the city of Rājagṛha, the caravan leader, Vimala, by name, returned
from across the ocean with a successful ship.He fed the Awakened, the Fortunate One, together
with a retinue of thousand two hundred and fifty monks. Each monk was presented with
the three garments.The entire world was filled with his fame saying: "Rightly has his ocean
voyage been fruitful, and rightly is he called ’caravan leader’ in that he has thus done
homage to the teaching of the Fortunate One."Hearing this, rivalry arose in the caravan
leader Divākara thinking:"I too will take to the ocean.If I return thence with a successful
ship,howsoever many disciples of the Fortunate One dwell in Jambudvīpa, I will ask the Fortunate
One, make them assemble in one place, regale them with excellent food and present
each monk with three garments of great value."This incident was related by him to his wifeand
she said: "Master, may your intentions prosper, may your wishes be fulfilled."Thereupon,
the caravan leader Divākara caused bells to be sounded three times in the city of Rājagṛha
and, accompanied by five hundred merchants, set out to sea.While he was at sea, the Fortunate
One entered into Nirvāṇa;and, while he was still there the Great Elder Kāśyapa, too,
entered into Nirvāṇa.
